Coastal ecosystems on a tipping point: Global warming and parasitism combine to alter community structure and function	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Mounting evidence suggests that the transmission of certain parasites is facilitated by increasing temperatures, causing their host population to decline. However, no study has yet addressed how temperature and parasitism may combine to shape the functional structure of a whole host community in the face of global warming. Here, we apply an outdoor mesocosm approach supported by field surveys to elucidate this question in a diverse intertidal community of amphipods infected by the pathogenic microphallid trematode, Maritrema novaezealandensis. Under present temperature (17 degrees C) and level of parasitism, the parasite had little impact on the host community. However, elevating the temperature to 21 degrees C in the presence of parasites induced massive structural changes: amphipod abundances decreased species-specifically, affecting epibenthic species but leaving infaunal species largely untouched. In effect, species diversity dropped significantly. In contrast, four degree higher temperatures in the absence of parasitism had limited influence on the amphipod community. Further elevating temperatures (19-25 degrees C) and parasitism, simulating a prolonged heat-wave scenario, resulted in an almost complete parasite-induced extermination of the amphipod community at 25 degrees C. In addition, at 19 degrees C, just two degrees above the present average, a similar temperature-parasite synergistic impact on community structure emerged as seen at 21 degrees C under lower parasite pressure. The heat-wave temperature of 25 degrees C per se affected the amphipod community in a comparable way: species diversity declined and the infaunal species were favoured at the expense of epibenthic species. Our experimental findings are corroborated by field data demonstrating a strong negative relationship between current amphipod species richness and the level of Maritrema parasitism across 12 sites. Hence, owing to the synergistic impact of temperature and parasitism, our study predicts that coastal amphipod communities will deteriorate in terms of abundance and diversity in face of anticipated global warming, functionally changing them to be dominated by infaunal species.

Impact of climate change and biodiversity collapse on the global emergence and spread of infectious diseases	JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH				Article								The reality of climate change and biodiversity collapse is irrefutable in the 21st century, with urgent action required not only to conserve threatened species but also to protect human life and wellbeing. This existential threat forces us to recognise that our existence is completely dependent upon well-functioning ecosystems that sustain the diversity of life on our planet, including that required for human health. By synthesising data on the ecology, epidemiology and evolutionary biology of various pathogens, we are gaining a better understanding of factors that underlie disease emergence and spread. However, our knowledge remains rudimentary with limited insight into the complex feedback loops that underlie ecological stability, which are at risk of rapidly unravelling once certain tipping points are breached. In this paper, we consider the impact of climate change and biodiversity collapse on the ever-present risk of infectious disease emergence and spread. We review historical and contemporaneous infectious diseases that have been influenced by human environmental manipulation, including zoonoses and vector- and water-borne diseases, alongside an evaluation of the impact of migration, urbanisation and human density on transmissible diseases. The current lack of urgency in political commitment to address climate change warrants enhanced understanding and action from paediatricians - to ensure that we safeguard the health and wellbeing of children in our care today, as well as those of future generations.

As a response to the multiple calls from scientists on that subject, we have here proposed seven long-term research questions regarding COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that are based on effective integration of environmental, ecological, evolutionary, and social sciences to better anticipate and mitigate EIDs. Research needs cover the social ecology of infectious disease agents, their evolution, the determinants of susceptibility of humans and animals to infections, and the human and ecological factors accelerating infectious disease emergence. For comprehensive investigation, they include the development of nature-based solutions to interlinked global planetary crises, addressing ethical and philosophical questions regarding the relationship of humans to nature and regarding transformative changes to safeguard the environment and human health. In support of this research, we propose the implementation of innovative multidisciplinary facilities embedded in social ecosystems locally: ecological health observatories and living laboratories. This work was carried out in the frame of the European Community project HERA (www. HERAresearchEU.eu), which aims to set priorities for an environment, climate and health research agenda in the European Union by adopting a systemic approach in the face of global environmental change.

J	Liu, Y; He, FL				Liu, Yu; He, Fangliang			Warming shifts soil microbial communities and tropical tree seedling mortality	ECOLOGY				Article								Plant-soil feedback (PSF), regulated by both mycorrhizae and soil-borne pathogens, is a primary mechanism maintaining high tree species diversity in the tropics. But how warming actually affects PSF is not well understood. We conducted a field warming experiment to test PSF on seedling mortality of two tree species: a rhizobia-associated tree (Ormosia semicastrata, Fabaceae) suffering from host-specific soil-borne pathogens and an ectomycorrhizal fungi-associated tree (Cyclobalanopsis patelliormis, Fagaceae) with low susceptibility to soil-borne pathogens. Soil fungi from the warming versus control seedling plots were identified by molecular sequencing. Results showed that the elevated temperature lowered seedling mortality of O. semicastrata, but had no effect on C. patelliormis seedlings. This indicates that warming weakened the negative PSF on O. semicastrata, presumably due to the observed decrease of the relative abundance of plant-pathogenic fungi and increase of ectomycorrhizal fungi but did not affect the PSF on C. patelliormis. The differential warming effects on seedling mortality of species with different microbial associations affords an example showcasing how the change in soil-borne microbes in response to global warming would, in turn, through PSF, alter tropical tree species composition and diversity. This study helps shed mechanistic light on the debate of biodiversity change as driven by climate change.

Climate Change Enhances the Potential Impact of Infectious Disease and Harvest on Tropical Waterfowl	BIOTROPICA				Review								Global warming exacerbates threats to biodiversity as ecological systems shift in response to altered climatic conditions. Yet the long-term survival of populations at direct risk from climate change may also be undermined by local factors such as infectious disease or anthropogenic harvest, which leave smaller and more isolated populations increasingly vulnerable to the rapid pace of global change. We review current and future threats to an exemplar tropical waterfowl species, magpie geese Anseranas semipalmata, and focus on the potential synergies between infectious diseases, harvest, and climate change. We outline viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens likely to cause disease in geese, and give mention to parasites. Further, we elaborate on a previously developed, spatially explicit population viability model to simulate demographic responses to hunting and novel or enhanced disease outbreaks due to climate change. With no harvest, the simulated disease epizootics only threatened metapopulation viability when both mortality rate was high and outbreaks were regular (a threshold response). However, when contemporary site-specific harvest is included as an additive impact, the response to disease severity and probability was linear. We recommend field research to test these hypotheses linking drivers of waterfowl population decline to disease-climate change interactions.	[Traill, Lochran W.; Bradshaw, Corey J.

Understanding the influence of climate change on infectious disease at temperate and tropical latitudes can be challenging because of numerous complicating biological, social, and political factors. Arctic and Subarctic regions may be particularly good models for unraveling the impacts of climate change on parasite ecology because they are relatively simple systems with low biological diversity and few other complicating anthropogenic factors. We examine some changing dynamics of host-parasite interactions at high latitudes and use these to illustrate a framework for approaching understanding, preventing, and mitigating climate change impacts on infectious disease, including zoonoses, in wildlife.

J	Nunn, CL; Altizer, SM; Sechrest, W; Cunningham, AA				Nunn, CL; Altizer, SM; Sechrest, W; Cunningham, AA			Latitudinal gradients of parasite species richness in primates	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				Article								Infectious disease risk is thought to increase in the tropics, but little is known about latitudinal gradients of parasite diversity. We used a comparative data set encompassing 330 parasite species reported from 119 primate hosts to examine latitudinal gradients in the diversity of micro and macroparasites per primate host species. Analyses conducted with and without controlling for host phylogeny showed that parasite species richness increased closer to the equator for protozoan parasites, but not for viruses or helminths. Relative to other major parasite groups, protozoa reported from wild primates were transmitted disproportionately by arthropod vectors. Within the protozoa, our results revealed that vector-borne parasites showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient in species richness. This higher diversity of vector-borne protozoa near the tropics could be influenced by a greater abundance or diversity of biting arthropods in the tropics, or by climatic effects on vector behaviour and parasite development. Many vector-borne diseases, such as leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and malaria pose risks to both humans and wildlife, and nearly one-third of the protozoan parasites from free-living primates in our data set have been reported to infect humans. Because the geographical distribution and prevalence of many vector-borne parasites are expected to increase because of global warming, these results are important for predicting future parasite-mediated threats to biodiversity and human health.

J.; Paull, Sara H.; Young, Suzanne			Using physiology to understand climate-driven changes in disease and their implications for conservation	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY				Review								Controversy persists regarding the contributions of climate change to biodiversity losses, through its effects on the spread and emergence of infectious diseases. One of the reasons for this controversy is that there are few mechanistic studies that explore the links among climate change, infectious disease, and declines of host populations. Given that host-parasite interactions are generally mediated by physiological responses, we submit that physiological models could facilitate the prediction of how host-parasite interactions will respond to climate change, and might offer theoretical and terminological cohesion that has been lacking in the climate change-disease literature. We stress that much of the work on how climate influences host-parasite interactions has emphasized changes in climatic means, despite a hallmark of climate change being changes in climatic variability and extremes. Owing to this gap, we highlight how temporal variability in weather, coupled with non-linearities in responses to mean climate, can be used to predict the effects of climate on host-parasite interactions. We also discuss the climate variability hypothesis for disease-related declines, which posits that increased unpredictable temperature variability might provide a temporary advantage to pathogens because they are smaller and have faster metabolisms than their hosts, allowing more rapid acclimatization following a temperature shift. In support of these hypotheses, we provide case studies on the role of climatic variability in host population declines associated with the emergence of the infectious diseases chytridiomycosis, withering syndrome, and malaria. Finally, we present a mathematical model that provides the scaffolding to integrate metabolic theory, physiological mechanisms, and large-scale spatiotemporal processes to predict how simultaneous changes in climatic means, variances, and extremes will affect host-parasite interactions. However, several outstanding questions remain to be answered before investigators can accurately predict how changes in climatic means and variances will affect infectious diseases and the conservation status of host populations.

J	Liu, Y; He, FL				Liu, Yu; He, Fangliang			Warming intensifies soil pathogen negative feedback on a temperate tree	NEW PHYTOLOGIST				Article								The soil pathogen-induced Janzen-Connell (JC) effect is considered as a primary mechanism regulating plant biodiversity worldwide. As predicted by the framework of the classic plant disease triangle, severity of plant diseases is often influenced by temperature, yet insufficient understanding of how increasing temperatures affect the JC effect contributes uncertainty in predictions about how global warming affects biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr field warming experiment, combining open-top chambers with pesticide treatment, to test the effect of elevated temperatures on seedling mortality of a temperate tree species, Prunus padus, from a genus with known susceptibility to soil-borne pathogens. Elevated temperature significantly increased the mortality of P. padus seedlings in the immediate vicinity of parent trees, concurrent with increased relative abundance of pathogenic fungi identified to be virulent to Prunus species. Our study offers experimental evidence suggesting that global warming significantly intensifies the JC effect on a temperate tree species due to increased relative abundance of pathogenic fungi. This work advances our understanding about changes in the JC effect linked to ongoing global warming, which has important implications for predicting tree diversity in a warmer future.

J	Griebel, A; Watson, D; Pendall, E				Griebel, Anne; Watson, David; Pendall, Elise			Mistletoe, friend and foe: synthesizing ecosystem implications of mistletoe infection	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS				Article								Biotic disturbances are affecting a wide range of tree species in all climates, and their occurrence is contributing to increasing rates of tree mortality globally. Mistletoe is a widespread group of parasitic plants that establishes long-lasting relationships with a diverse range of host tree species. With climate change, ecophysiological stress is increasing, potentially making trees more susceptible to mistletoe infection, which in turn leads to higher forest mortality rates. The perception of mistletoe presence in individual trees and forest stands is divided within the scientific community, leading to an ongoing debate regarding its impacts. Forest managers concerned about stand health and carbon sequestration may view mistletoe as a foe that leads to reduced productivity. In contrast, ecologists may see mistletoe as a friend, in light of the wildlife habitat, biodiversity and nutrient cycling it promotes. However, individual studies typically focus on isolated effects of mistletoe presence within their respective research area and lack a balanced, interdisciplinary perspective of mistletoe disturbance. With this conceptual paper we aim to bring together the positive and negative impacts of mistletoe presence on tree physiology, soil nutrient cycling as well as stand health and stand dynamics. We focus on the role of mistletoe-induced tree mortality in ecosystem succession and biodiversity. In addition, we present potential modifications of mistletoe presence on the energy budget and on forest vulnerability to climate change, which could feed back into stand dynamics and disturbance patterns. Lastly, we will identify the most pressing remaining knowledge gaps and highlight priorities for future research on this widespread agent of biotic disturbance.

Pathogens of domestic and free-ranging ungulates: global climate change in temperate to boreal latitudes across North America	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				Article								In North America broad-based research networks explore the interaction of vertebrates, their characteristic arrays of pathogens and emergent disease. A diversity of programmes address the impact of environmental change on animal health, zoonoses, and human health, but as yet no comprehensive framework or strategy has emerged to develop and implement policy and planning. In a regime of climate change and ecological perturbation, the need to document and understand the health, agricultural, societal and economic impact of pathogens and emerging infectious disease is urgent. An integrated and proactive planning process linking national and international resources can lead to informed predictions about the impact of environmental change and can identify pathways for potential management and mitigation. An effective and comprehensive programme will have components for establishing priorities, developing primary data for faunal structure and biodiversity, a capacity for monitoring and surveillance (including scanning and targeted activities), and linkage to historical and contemporary baselines (against which to assess change) established through archival biological collections. Field and laboratory studies are also necessary to determine developmental thresholds, tolerances and tipping points for many pathogens to establish a context for recognising current constraints and future perturbation, and to explore factors that promote emergence for a variety of pathogens, vectors and pest species. Predictive modelling and risk assessment utilising a range of scenarios for climate change is a final step in this multidisciplinary process.	[Hoberg, E.

Forecasting these changes and designing adequate management of future ecosystem services will require predictive models encompassing the most fundamental biotic responses. However, most present models omit important processes such as evolution and competition(4,5). Here we develop a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of multi-species responses to climate change. We demonstrate that both dispersal and evolution differentially mediate extinction risks and biodiversity alterations through time and across climate gradients. Together, high genetic variance and low dispersal best minimized extinction risks. Surprisingly, high dispersal did not reduce extinctions, because the shifting ranges of some species hastened the decline of others. Evolutionary responses dominated during the later stages of climatic changes and in hot regions. No extinctions occurred without competition, which highlights the importance of including species interactions in global biodiversity models. Most notably, climate change created extinction and evolutionary debts, with changes in species richness and traits occuring long after climate stabilization. Therefore, even if we halt anthropogenic climate change today, transient eco-evolutionary dynamics would ensure centuries of additional alterations in global biodiversity.

J	Garbelotto, M; Pautasso, M				Garbelotto, Matteo; Pautasso, Marco			Impacts of exotic forest pathogens on Mediterranean ecosystems: four case studies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY				Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Conference of the European-Foundation-for-Plant-Pathology	NOV 15-18, 2010	Univ Evora, Evora, PORTUGAL		Univ Evora			Mediterranean ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity. Because of a coincidence of high species richness and human presence, Mediterranean biodiversity is particularly threatened by processes such as habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss, pollution, climate change and introduction of invasive species. Invasive tree pathogens are among the problematic exotic species of California, Chile, the Mediterranean, South Africa and Australia. In this review, we provide an update on a selection of non-native tree pathogens currently posing a threat in Mediterranean ecosystems. The impact of exotic forest pathogens range from large-scale tree and shrub mortality in native ecosystems (Phytophthora ramorum on the West Coast of the USA) to disruption of plantations of exotic (e.g., Seiridium cardinale on planted Monterey cypress in California, Fusarium circinatum on Monterey pine worldwide) and native trees (introduction of the North American Heterobasidion irregulare in stone pine woodland in Italy). Genetic analyses are instrumental in improving our understanding and management of these outbreaks. There is a need for more empirical data on how novel pathosystems are likely to develop under novel climates, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations among forest pathologists, theoretical modellers and climatologists. The magnitude of the observed effects of some exotic tree diseases makes it important to try and minimize the risk of the inadvertent movement of plant pathogens when planning assisted migration activities to enable plant species to cope with rapid climate change.

Ecophysiology meets conservation: understanding the role of disease in amphibian population declines	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Review								Infectious diseases are intimately associated with the dynamics of biodiversity. However, the role that infectious disease plays within ecological communities is complex. The complex effects of infectious disease at the scale of communities and ecosystems are driven by the interaction between host and pathogen. Whether or not a given host-pathogen interaction results in progression from infection to disease is largely dependent on the physiological characteristics of the host within the context of the external environment. Here, we highlight the importance of understanding the outcome of infection and disease in the context of host ecophysiology using amphibians as a model system. Amphibians are ideal for such a discussion because many of their populations are experiencing declines and extinctions, with disease as an important factor implicated in many declines and extinctions. Exposure to pathogens and the host's responses to infection can be influenced by many factors related to physiology such as host life history, immunology, endocrinology, resource acquisition, behaviour and changing climates. In our review, we discuss the relationship between disease and biodiversity. We highlight the dynamics of three amphibian host-pathogen systems that induce different effects on hosts and life stages and illustrate the complexity of amphibian-host-parasite systems. We then review links between environmental stress, endocrine-immune interactions, disease and climate change.

Making thirsty cities sustainable: A nexus approach for water provisioning in Quito, Ecuador	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				Article								In view of accelerated climate change and urban demographics, balancing human and ecosystem needs for water resources is a critical environmental challenge of global significance. Since water, agriculture, health, and energy are inextricably linked, sustainable development goals (SDGs) actions in one policy area commonly have impacts on the others, as well as on the ecosystems that natural resources and human activities ultimately depend upon. Managing urban water supply systems therefore requires a nexus approach that integrates goals across sectors, reduces the risk that SDG actions will undermine one another, and ensures sustainable resource use. We developed a transdisciplinary methodological framework based on a Pareto frontier analysis to define the sus-tainable solutions of a multi-objective optimization among four competing criteria, water provision, water quality, energy cost, and biodiversity conservation. The study was applied to three mountainous headwater basins in the Ecuadorian Andes, which provide around 30% of Quito's total water supply. We found that an optimized management of water intake structures would meet current consumption needs while reducing the probability of emergence of water pathogens and limiting the impact on aquatic biodiversity by 30% and 9% respectively, without any increase in energy costs for pumping water from other sources. Nonetheless, under future scenarios of climate change and water demand, higher energy consumption, and therefore an increase in operating costs, would be needed to meet urban demand and preserve environmental conditions. Overall, the range of Pareto optimal water supply strategies across the water-health-energy-biodiversity nexus provides valuable information for decision makers and offers support for achieving sustainable management of water resources.

Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog ( Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad ( Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with 'very high confidence' (>99%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable.

In a multidisciplinary approach using 90-year (1930-2020) climate-growth data, we investigated the dynamics of climate variability on growth and resilience of the tropical African baobab (Adansonia digitata) at the range edge in climate-variable, southeast Africa. The main driver of climate variability, ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation), triggered 83% of droughts exacerbated by positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) events. Growth over 90 years was positively correlated with maximum temperature and increased after the 1976-1977 Global Warming Shift. The influence of warming was compromised by climate variability and extreme events. Although growth is a measure of adaptive capacity, accelerated growth over the past 20 years contrasted with dehydration, canopy dieback and a novel Didymella pathogen. Resilience was contingent on high genetic diversity (polyploidy and heterozygosity) and Neotropical legacy effects of stem water storage and longevity trade-offs of low growth, recruitment and reproduction. The evolution of resprouting in disturbed, fire-prone ecosystems and bark regeneration increased recovery from disturbance. As resource opportunists, baobabs adopted a fast-slow survival strategy. Rainfall and warming enhanced growth while low and variable rainfall favoured a conservative, low growth-higher survival strategy. Low rainfall, climate extremes and topography increased mortality risk. Mortality was higher at lower elevations on site and regionally. Low growth may conserve the baobab in climate warming but the southern hemisphere tropics is one of two identified global hotspots with amplified hot years. The heightened disturbance predicted from increased climate variability, hot droughts and landfalling tropical cyclones magnifies mortality risk for "Africa's favourite tree."

J	Auld, SKJR; Brand, J				Auld, Stuart K. J. R.; Brand, June			Simulated climate change, epidemic size, and host evolution across host-parasite populations	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Climate change is causing warmer and more variable temperatures as well as physical flux in natural populations, which will affect the ecology and evolution of infectious disease epidemics. Using replicate seminatural populations of a coevolving freshwater invertebrate-parasite system (host: Daphnia magna, parasite: Pasteuria ramosa), we quantified the effects of ambient temperature and population mixing (physical flux within populations) on epidemic size and population health. Each population was seeded with an identical suite of host genotypes and dose of parasite transmission spores. Biologically reasonable increases in environmental temperature caused larger epidemics, and population mixing reduced overall epidemic size. Mixing also had a detrimental effect on host populations independent of disease. Epidemics drove parasite-mediated selection, leading to a loss of host genetic diversity, and mixed populations experienced greater evolution due to genetic drift over the season. These findings further our understanding of how diversity loss will reduce the host populations' capacity to respond to changes in selection, therefore stymying adaptation to further environmental change.

Host range of the stem canker pathogen Luteocirrhus shearii mainly limited to Banksia	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY				Article								Isolations from diseased plants and controlled inoculations indicate that the host range of the canker pathogen Luteocirrhus shearii is mainly limited to Banksia. Branches exhibiting canker symptoms were sampled from the Geraldton Sandplains, Swan Coastal Plain, Jarrah Forest, Warren and Esperance Sandplains bioregions of the South-West Botanical Province of Western Australia (n = 1,351). Luteocirrhus shearii was isolated from only Proteaceae and did not infect wound inoculated Myrtaceae. The pathogen was isolated from or formed extensive lesions in 15 Banksia species. Differences in isolation frequency and rates of lesion extension of L. shearii between Banksia spp. may indicate different modes of infection by the canker pathogen. By exerting top-down control of population dynamics of Banksia communities from lower trophic levels, L. shearii would substantially alter host species diversity and in turn ecosystem processes. Predicted climate change could influence future biotic reorganisations following L. shearii invasion. What determines the limited host range of L. shearii compared to the community of organisms on Banksia needs to be determined.	[Shearer, B. L.; Crane, C.

Yet, we have limited understanding of the consequences of evolutionary history on the structure of food webs and the services provided by biological communities. Drawing on 11 years of data from a long-term plant diversity experiment, we show that evolutionary history of plant communities measured as phylogenetic diversity strongly predicts diversity and abundance of herbivorous and predatory arthropods. Effects of plant species richness on arthropods become stronger when phylogenetic diversity is high. Plant phylogenetic diversity explains predator and parasitoid richness as strongly as it does herbivore richness. Our findings indicate that accounting for evolutionary relationships is critical to understanding the severity of species loss for food webs and ecosystems, and for developing conservation and restoration policies.

Review: Challenges for dairy cow production systems arising from climate changes	ANIMAL				Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Ruminant Physiology (ISRP)	SEP 03-06, 2019	Leipzig, GERMANY					The so-called global change refers to changes on a planetary scale. The term encompasses various issues like resource use, energy development, population growth, land use and land cover, carbon and nitrogen cycle, pollution and health, and climate change. The paper deals with challenges for dairy cattle production systems in Europe arising from climate change as one part of global changes. Global warming is increasing, and therefore ecosystems, plant and animal biodiversity, and food security and safety are at risk. It is already accepted knowledge that the direct and indirect effects of global warming in combination with an increasing frequency of weather extremes are a serious issue for livestock production, even in moderate climate zones like Central Europe. The potential and already-measurable effects of climate change (including increase in temperature, frequency of hot days and heat waves), in particular the challenges on grassland production, fodder quality, nutrition in general, cow welfare, health as well as performance of dairy production, will be reviewed. Indirect and direct effects on animals are correlated with their performance. There are clear indications that with selection for high-yielding animals the sensitivity to climate changes increases. Cumulative effects (e.g. higher temperature plus increased pathogen and their vectors loads) do strengthen these impacts. To cope with the consequences several possible adaptation and mitigation strategies must be established on different levels. This includes changes in the production systems (e.g. management, barn, feeding), breeding strategies and health management.

Extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of parasite prevalence and parasite species richness in a marine bivalve	PLOS ONE				Article								Parasite species richness is influenced by a range of drivers including host related factors (e.g. host size) and environmental factors (e.g. seawater temperature). However, identification of modulators of parasite species richness remains one of the great unanswered questions in ecology. The common cockle Cerastoderma edule is renowned for its diversity and abundance of parasites, yet drivers of parasite species richness in cockles have not been examined to investigate the association of both macro and microparasite communities. Using cockles as a model species, some of the key drivers of parasite prevalence and parasite species richness were investigated. Objectives of this 19-month survey were to determine the influence of the environment, host-parasite dynamics and parasite associations on parasite species richness and prevalence at two different geographic latitudes, chosen based on environmental differences. The highest parasite species richness was recorded in the northern sites, and this was potentially influenced by a range of interactions between the host, the pathogens and the environment. Parasite prevalence increased with host size and age, and parasite species richness increased with reduced salinity. A number of interactions between parasites, and between parasites and pathologies may be influencing parasite infection dynamics. New and concerning information is also presented regarding interactions between parasites and their environment. A number of parasites and potential pathogens (bacteria, Trichodina ciliates, metacercariae, trematode sporocysts) may be advantaged under climate change conditions (warming seas, increased precipitation), increasing disease incidence, which may prove detrimental not just for cockles, but for other bivalve species in the future.

Eutrophication, biodiversity loss, and species invasions modify the relationship between host and parasite richness during host community assembly	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Host and parasite richness are generally positively correlated, but the stability of this relationship in response to global change remains poorly understood. Rapidly changing biotic and abiotic conditions can alter host community assembly, which in turn, can alter parasite transmission. Consequently, if the relationship between host and parasite richness is sensitive to parasite transmission, then changes in host composition under various global change scenarios could strengthen or weaken the relationship between host and parasite richness. To test the hypothesis that host community assembly can alter the relationship between host and parasite richness in response to global change, we experimentally crossed host diversity (biodiversity loss) and resource supply to hosts (eutrophication), then allowed communities to assemble. As previously shown, initial host diversity and resource supply determined the trajectory of host community assembly, altering post-assembly host species richness, richness-independent host phylogenetic diversity, and colonization by exotic host species. Overall, host richness predicted parasite richness, and as predicted, this effect was moderated by exotic abundance-communities dominated by exotic species exhibited a stronger positive relationship between post-assembly host and parasite richness. Ultimately, these results suggest that, by modulating parasite transmission, community assembly can modify the relationship between host and parasite richness. These results thus provide a novel mechanism to explain how global environmental change can generate contingencies in a fundamental ecological relationship-the positive relationship between host and parasite richness.

The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity and composition of fungal communities associated with the functional tissues and rhizosphere soil of healthy-looking Picea abies to better understand these fungal communities and their potential effect on tree health in the process of climate change. The study sites included 30 P. abies stands, where needles, shoots, roots, and the rhizosphere soil was sampled. DNA was isolated from individual samples, amplified using ITS2 rRNA as a marker and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. The sequence analysis showed the presence of 232,547 high-quality reads, which following clustering were found to represent 2701 non-singleton fungal OTUs. The highest absolute richness of fungal OTUs was in the soil (1895), then in the needles (1049) and shoots (1002), and the lowest was in the roots (641). The overall fungal community was composed of Ascomycota (58.3%), Basidiomycota (37.2%), Zygomycota (2.5%), Chytridiomycota (1.6%), and Glomeromycota (0.4%). The most common fungi based on sequence read abundance were Aspergillus pseudoglaucus (7.9%), Archaeorhizomyces sp. (3.6%), and Rhinocladiella sp. (2.0%). Pathogens were relatively rare, among which the most common were Phacidium lacerum (1.7%), Cyphellophora sessilis (1.4%), and Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii (1.4%). The results showed that the detected diversity of fungal OTUs was generally high, but their relative abundance varied greatly among different study sites, thereby highlighting the complexity of interactions among the host trees, fungi, and local environmental conditions.

J	Dixon, GR				Dixon, Geoffrey Richard			Climate change - impact on crop growth and food production, and plant pathogens	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY				Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual General Meeting of the Canadian-Phytopathological-Society/Symposium on Contributions of Genomics to Plant PathologySymposium on Emerging Stresses on Forests and Agro-Ecosystems Resulting from Climate Change held during the Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Phytopathological-SocietyCanadian-Phytopathological-Society and Plant Canada	JUN 20-23, 2010JUN, 2010JUL 17-21, 2011	Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADAHalifax, CANADA					Climates are changing worldwide at rates not seen previously in geological time. This affects food production itself and the growth and reproduction of plant pathogens which reduce crop yield and quality. There is a need to develop an understanding of the implications and impacts of climate change on natural biodiversity, artificial landscapes as well as production agriculture (defined here as a generalization embracing all of the primary uses of land for agriculture, horticulture and forestry), since these form parts of an integrated continuum. Currently, 20-25% of harvested crops worldwide are lost to pre- and post-harvest diseases and climatic change is expected to increase these losses. Climatic change results in increasing variability and altered scales of temperature, rainfall and wind velocity and periodicity. These changes affect the activities and vigour of aerial and soilborne pathogens. Some pathogens capable of devastating crops and harvested produce have become more active and damaging because their geographical ranges expand as a consequence of climate change. Human populations are increasing rapidly, resulting in greater demands on all natural resources which far outstrip supplies. Natural biodiversity is being damaged, frequently beyond repair and not infrequently with little or no knowledge of the characteristics of the plant genotypes being lost. Only very recently have analyses of ecosystem services begun revealing the intricate and delicate webs of unappreciated natural assets which are vital for human sustainable (used here to describe processes and actions which balance resource-use with resource-availability and conserve economic, environmental and social welfare) survival. The combination of climatic change, expanding human demands for food, resources and space and the increased activities of plant pathogens presents pathologists with immense challenges. Previously, visionary plant pathologists have contributed hugely to solving humanity's problems. Current challenges compounded by climate change offer opportunities for the exploitation of our profession's capacities for working with 'one foot in the furrow (and) one hand on the bench' with increasing relevance for society at large.

Biodiversity loss affects infectious disease risk by disrupting normal relationships between hosts and pathogens. Mosquito-borne pathogens respond to changing dynamics on multiple transmission levels and appear to increase in disturbed systems, yet current knowledge of mosquito diversity and the relative abundance of vectors as a function of habitat change is limited. We characterize mosquito communities across habitats with differing levels of anthropogenic ecological disturbance in central Thailand. During the 2008 rainy season, adult mosquito collections from 24 sites, representing 6 habitat types ranging from forest to urban, yielded 62,126 intact female mosquitoes (83,325 total mosquitoes) that were assigned to 109 taxa. Female mosquito abundance was highest in rice fields and lowest in forests. Diversity indices and rarefied species richness estimates indicate the mosquito fauna was more diverse in rural and less diverse in rice field habitats, while extrapolated estimates of true richness (Chao1 and ACE) indicated higher diversity in the forest and fragmented forest habitats and lower diversity in the urban. Culex sp. (Vishnui subgroup) was the most common taxon found overall and the most frequent in fragmented forest, rice field, rural, and suburban habitats. The distributions of species of medical importance differed significantly across habitat types and were always lowest in the intact, forest habitat. The relative abundance of key vector species, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, was negatively correlated with diversity, suggesting that direct species interactions and/or habitat-mediated factors differentially affecting invasive disease vectors may be important mechanisms linking biodiversity loss to human health. Our results are an important first step for understanding the dynamics of mosquito vector distributions under changing environmental features across landscapes of Thailand.

Climate forcing of an emerging pathogenic fungus across a montane multi-host community	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								Changes in the timings of seasonality as a result of anthropogenic climate change are predicted to occur over the coming decades. While this is expected to have widespread impacts on the dynamics of infectious disease through environmental forcing, empirical data are lacking. Here, we investigated whether seasonality, specifically the timing of spring ice-thaw, affected susceptibility to infection by the emerging pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) across a montane community of amphibians that are suffering declines and extirpations as a consequence of this infection. We found a robust temporal association between the timing of the spring thaw and Bd infection in two host species, where we show that an early onset of spring forced high prevalences of infection. A third highly susceptible species (the midwife toad, Alytes obstetricans) maintained a high prevalence of infection independent of time of spring thaw. Our data show that perennially overwintering midwife toad larvae may act as a year-round reservoir of infection with variation in time of spring thaw determining the extent to which infection spills over into sympatric species. We used future temperature projections based on global climate models to demonstrate that the timing of spring thaw in this region will advance markedly by the 2050s, indicating that climate change will further force the severity of infection. Our findings on the effect of annual variability on multi-host infection dynamics show that the community-level impact of fungal infectious disease on biodiversity will need to be re-evaluated in the face of climate change.

S	Palm, HW		Mehlhorn, H		Palm, Harry W.			Fish Parasites as Biological Indicators in a Changing World: Can We Monitor Environmental Impact and Climate Change?	PROGRESS IN PARASITOLOGY	Parasitology Research Monograph			Article; Book Chapter								Global warming scenarios combined with political and public awareness have led to increasing funding and research efforts on the measurement and prediction of effects of a changing world on the ecosystems. Fish parasites represent a major part of aquatic biodiversity, and consequently become affected either directly through the environment or indirectly through their respective hosts. On the basis of a conservative estimate of an average of 3-4 fish parasites in each existing fish species alone and a current number of 31,400 described fish species, we can estimate the existence of up to 120,000 fish parasite species, including both protozoans and metazoans. Combined with a number of life cycle stages that may infect all aquatic hosts and organs, this vast biodiversity represents a widely neglected tool for a variety of ecology-based applications. Studies have demonstrated that fish parasites can serve as biological indicator organisms to illustrate the ecology of their infected hosts, including feeding, migration and population structure. Parasite metrics have been connected to specific environmental conditions, and they can indicate different pollutants such as heavy metal concentrations, industrial and sewage pollution, and also eutrophication. Most recently, parasite infections have been connected to anthropogenic impact and environmental change also in marine habitats. This book chapter summarizes the use of fish parasites as biological indicators, and discusses their potential and the requirements in the utilization of fish parasites as biological indicators of climate change.

J	Hoberg, EP; Brooks, DR				Hoberg, Eric P.; Brooks, Daniel R.			Evolution in action: climate change, biodiversity dynamics and emerging infectious disease	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								Climatological variation and ecological perturbation have been pervasive drivers of faunal assembly, structure and diversification for parasites and pathogens through recurrent events of geographical and host colonization at varying spatial and temporal scales of Earth history. Episodic shifts in climate and environmental settings, in conjunction with ecological mechanisms and host switching, are often critical determinants of parasite diversification, a view counter to more than a century of coevolutionary thinking about the nature of complex host-parasite assemblages. Parasites are resource specialists with restricted host ranges, yet shifts onto relatively unrelated hosts are common during phylogenetic diversification of parasite lineages and directly observable in real time. The emerging Stockholm Paradigm resolves this paradox: Ecological Fitting (EF)-phenotypic flexibility and phylogenetic conservatism in traits related to resource use, most notably host preference-provides many opportunities for rapid host switching in changing environments, without the evolution of novel host-utilization capabilities. Host shifts via EF fuel the expansion phase of the Oscillation Hypothesis of host range and speciation and, more generally, the generation of novel combinations of interacting species within the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. In synergy, an environmental dynamic of Taxon Pulses establishes an episodic context for host and geographical colonization.

EMERGING THREATS TO TROPICAL FORESTS	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN				Article								I highlight new and emerging threats to tropical forests, the world's most biologically diverse ecosystems. The drivers of tropical forest destruction and key perils to biodiversity have changed over the past decade and will continue to evolve in the future. Industrial drivers of forest conversion, such as logging, large-scale soy and cattle farming, oil-palm plantations, and oil and gas development, have escalated in importance, buoyed by rapid globalization, economic growth, and rising standards of living in developing nations. Biofuels are likely to grow rapidly as a driver of future forest destruction. Climate change is similarly emerging as a potentially serious driver of change in the tropics, and many species, including certain amphibians, primates, and plants, are being harmed by emerging pathogens.. In general, old-growth forests are vanishing rapidly and being replaced by fragmented, secondary, and selectively logged forests, particularly in impoverished tropical countries. Road expansion continues apace and is increasingly imperiling the world's last tropical frontiers. Human population growth, especially in developing nations, remains an important underlying threat to forests. These various environmental dangers often operate in concert, magnifying their impacts and posing an even greater threat to tropical forests and their biodiversity.

J	Lafferty, KD; Gerber, LR				Lafferty, KD; Gerber, LR			Good medicine for conservation biology: The intersection of epidemiology and conservation theory	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY				Review								Infectious disease can be a concern for several aspects of conservation biology, such as determining threats to species, estimating population viability, and designing reserves, captive breeding, and recovery programs. Several measures are useful for describing infectious diseases in host populations, but it is not straightforward to determine the degree to which a particular disease may affect a host population. The most basic epidemiological theory suggests that populations should be least subject to host-specific infectious disease when they are at low abundance ( paradoxically, the state at which they are in most need of conservation action). There are important exceptions, however, such as when a reservoir host exists or when Allee or stochastic effects occur. Several of the key threats to biodiversity-habitat alteration, introduced species, pollution, resource exploitation, and climate change-can facilitate and/or impair transmission of infectious disease. Common management tools such as population viability analysis rarely address infectious disease explicitly. We suggest that such an inclusion is both possible and warranted. Considerations of infectious disease may influence the way we determine whether a species is in need of protection and how we might design reserves and captive breeding programs. Examples from the literature suggest that (1) introduced pathogens can make abundant species rare and (2) diseases of domestic animals can dramatically affect rare species. For both scenarios, conditions that cause stress or reduce genetic variation may increase susceptibility to disease, whereas crowding and cross-species contact can increase transmission. Southern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris nereis ) make an interesting case study for consideration of the intersection of epidemiology and conservation because disease may be an important factor limiting the growth of otter populations. We conclude that pathogens are of increasing concern for conservation. Because many newly emerging pathogen dynamics often do not conform to the simplifying assumptions used in classic epidemiology, a detailed understanding of pathogen life history will illuminate the intersection of epidemiology and conservation theory.

Conservation of biodiversity as a strategy for improving human health and well-being	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Review								The Earth's ecosystems have been altered by anthropogenic processes, including land use, harvesting populations, species introductions and climate change. These anthropogenic processes greatly alter plant and animal communities, thereby changing transmission of the zoonotic pathogens they carry. Biodiversity conservation may be a potential win-win strategy for maintaining ecosystem health and protecting public health, yet the causal evidence to support this strategy is limited. Evaluating conservation as a viable public health intervention requires answering four questions: (i) Is there a general and causal relationship between biodiversity and pathogen transmission, and if so, which direction is it in? (ii) Does increased pathogen diversity with increased host biodiversity result in an increase in total disease burden? (iii) Do the net benefits of biodiversity conservation to human wellbeing outweigh the benefits that biodiversity-degrading activities, such as agriculture and resource utilization, provide? (iv) Are biodiversity conservation interventions cost-effective when compared to other options employed in standard public health approaches? Here, we summarize current knowledge on biodiversity-zoonotic disease relationships and outline a research plan to address the gaps in our understanding for each of these four questions. Developing practical and self-sustaining biodiversity conservation interventions will require significant investment in disease ecology research to determine when and where they will be effective.

In this paper we present three case-studies of emerging parasitic infections and diseases in ungulates in the Canadian north. First we discuss climate warming as an important driver for the emergence of disease associated with Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis, a nematode lungworm of muskoxen. Then we examine how Protostrongylus stilesi, the sheep lungworm, emerged (or re-emerged) in muskoxen after re-introduction of this host into its historical range made it sympatric with Dall's sheep. Finally, we consider Teladorsagia boreoarcticus, a newly described and common abomasal nematode of muskoxen that is emerging as a disease-causing parasite and may be an important regulator for muskox populations on Banks Island, Northwest Territories. These and other arctic host-parasite systems are exquisitely tuned and constrained by a harsh and highly seasonal environment. The dynamics of these systems will be impacted by climate change and other ecological disruptions. Baseline knowledge of parasite biodiversity and parasite and host ecology, together with predictive models and long-term monitoring programs, are essential for anticipating and detecting altered patterns of host range, geographic distribution, and the emergence of parasitic infections and diseases.

J	Liu, Y; He, FL				Liu, Yu; He, Fangliang			Incorporating the disease triangle framework for testing the effect of soil-borne pathogens on tree species diversity	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				Review								1. The enemy-induced Janzen-Connell ( JC) effect, a classic model invoking conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and distance dependence, is a primary biodiversity maintenance hypothesis. Yet, conflicting evidence for the JC effect leads to disagreement about its role in maintaining forest diversity. 2. We focus this review on soil-borne pathogens, which are the primary agent inducing the JC effect in many forest ecosystems. Although the test of the pathogeninduced JC effect in ecology critically rests on the seedling mortality caused by soil pathogens, what has not been explicitly explored in the early literature but has increasingly received attention is the long-recognized fact that the environment can alter virulence of pathogens and host susceptibility (thus pathogen-host interactions), as predicted by the classic disease triangle framework enlightened by pathology research in agricultural systems. 3. Here, following the disease triangle framework we review evidence on how the pathogen-induced JC effect may be contingent on context (e.g. environmental conditions, pathogen inoculum load and genetic divergence in host and pathogen populations). The reviewed evidence reveals and clarifies the conditions where pathogens may or may not cause disease to hosts, thus contributing to reconciling the inconsistent results about the pathogen-induced JC effect in the literature. The context dependence of the disease triangle predicts that the pathogen-induced JC effect would change under global change. 4. Gaining insights from evidence that the pathogen-induced JC effect is context-dependent, we suggest that future tests on the JC hypothesis be conducted under the framework of disease triangle, and we stress the necessity by controlling the effect of context factors on plant-pathogen interactions when testing for the JC effect. We conclude the review by proposing three lines of future research for testing the importance of the JC effect in maintaining global forest tree species diversity, with a particular emphasis on testing the effect of global warming on the strength of pathogen-host interactions for better predicting changes of forest biodiversity under climate change.

J	Collins, JP				Collins, James P.			Amphibian decline and extinction: What we know and what we need to learn	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS				Article								For over 350 million yr, thousands of amphibian species have lived on Earth. Since the 1980s, amphibians have been disappearing at an alarming rate, in many cases quite suddenly. What is causing these declines and extinctions? In the modern era (post 1500) there are 6 leading causes of biodiversity loss in general, and all of these acting alone or together are responsible for modern amphibian declines: commercial use; introduced/exotic species that compete with, prey on, and parasitize native frogs and salamanders; land use change; contaminants; climate change; and infectious disease. The first 3 causes are historical in the sense that they have been operating for hundreds of years, although the rate of change due to each accelerated greatly after about the mid-20th century. Contaminants, climate change, and emerging infectious diseases are modern causes suspected of being responsible for the so-called 'enigmatic decline' of amphibians in protected areas. Introduced/exotic pathogens, land use change, and infectious disease are the 3 causes with a clear role in amphibian decline as well as extinction; thus far, the other 3 causes are only implicated in decline and not extinction. The present work is a review of the 6 causes with a focus on pathogens and suggested areas where new research is needed. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a chytrid fungus that is an emerging infectious disease causing amphibian population decline and species extinction. Historically, pathogens have not been seen as a major cause of extinction, but Bd is an exception, which is why it is such an interesting, important pathogen to understand. The late 20th and early 21st century global biodiversity loss is characterized as a sixth extinction event. Amphibians are a striking example of these losses as they disappear at a rate that greatly exceeds historical levels. Consequently, modern amphibian decline and extinction is a lens through which we can view the larger story of biodiversity loss and its consequences.

Recognizing a nexus of professional opportunities and global public need, we gathered at the Cedar Point Biological Station of the University of Nebraska in September 2012 to formulate a cooperative and broad platform for providing essential information about the evolution, ecology, and epidemiology of parasites across host groups, parasite groups, geographical regions, and ecosystem types. A general protocol, documentation assessment monitoring action (DAMA), suggests an integrated proposal to build a proactive capacity to understand, anticipate, and respond to the outcomes of accelerating environmental change. We seek to catalyze discussion and mobilize action within the parasitological community and, more widely, among zoologists and disease ecologists at a time of expanding environmental perturbation.

However, global burden of disease studies suggest that infectious diseases will contribute a proportionately smaller burden of disease over the next 2 decades as non-communicable diseases emerge as public health problems. However, infectious diseases contribute proportionately more in the poorest quintile of the population. Notwithstanding the different views of the impact of global warming on vector-borne infections this paper reviews the conditions which drive the changing epidemiology of these infections and suggests that such change is linked by common themes including interactions of generalist vectors and reservoir hosts at interfaces with humans, reduced biodiversity associated with anthropogenic environmental changes, increases in Plasmodium falciparum:P. vivax ratios and well-described land use changes such as hydrological, urbanization, agricultural, mining and forest-associated impacts (extractive activities, road building, deforestation and migration) which are seen on a global scale.

Mammal assemblage composition predicts global patterns in emerging infectious disease risk	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								As a source of emerging infectious diseases, wildlife assemblages (and related spatial patterns) must be quantitatively assessed to help identify high-risk locations. Previous assessments have largely focussed on the distributions of individual species; however, transmission dynamics are expected to depend on assemblage composition. Moreover, disease-diversity relationships have mainly been studied in the context of species loss, but assemblage composition and disease risk (e.g. infection prevalence in wildlife assemblages) can change without extinction. Based on the predicted distributions and abundances of 4466 mammal species, we estimated global patterns of disease risk through the calculation of the community-level basic reproductive ratio R0, an index of invasion potential, persistence, and maximum prevalence of a pathogen in a wildlife assemblage. For density-dependent diseases, we found that, in addition to tropical areas which are commonly viewed as infectious disease hotspots, northern temperate latitudes included high-risk areas. We also forecasted the effects of climate change and habitat loss from 2015 to 2035. Over this period, many local assemblages showed no net loss of species richness, but the assemblage composition (i.e. the mix of species and their abundances) changed considerably. Simultaneously, most areas experienced a decreased risk of density-dependent diseases but an increased risk of frequency-dependent diseases. We further explored the factors driving these changes in disease risk. Our results suggest that biodiversity and changes therein jointly influence disease risk. Understanding these changes and their drivers and ultimately identifying emerging infectious disease hotspots can help health officials prioritize resource distribution.	[Wang, Yingying X.

J	McCallum, H				McCallum, Hamish			Disease and the dynamics of extinction	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								Invading infectious diseases can, in theory, lead to the extinction of host populations, particularly if reservoir species are present or if disease transmission is frequency-dependent. The number of historic or prehistoric extinctions that can unequivocally be attributed to infectious disease is relatively small, but gathering firm evidence in retrospect is extremely difficult. Amphibian chytridiomycosis and Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) are two very different infectious diseases that are currently threatening to cause extinctions in Australia. These provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the processes of disease-induced extinction and possible management strategies. Both diseases are apparently recent in origin. Tasmanian DFTD is entirely host-specific but potentially able to cause extinction because transmission depends weakly, if at all, on host density. Amphibian chytridiomycosis has a broad host range but is highly pathogenic only to some populations of some species. At present, both diseases can only be managed by attempting to isolate individuals or populations from disease. Management options to accelerate the process of evolution of host resistance or tolerance are being investigated in both cases. Anthropogenic changes including movement of diseases and hosts, habitat destruction and fragmentation and climate change are likely to increase emerging disease threats to biodiversity and it is critical to further develop strategies to manage these threats.

This study aimed to investigate the distribution and genetic diversity of anisakid nematodes of the genus Anisakis sampled in cetaceans from the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. A total of 478 adults and pre-adults of Anisakis spp. was identified by a multilocus genetic approach (mtDNA cox2, EF1 alpha - 1 nDNA and nas 10 nDNA gene loci) from 11 cetacean species. A clear pattern of host preference was observed for Anisakis spp. at cetacean family level: A. simplex (s.s.) and A. pegreffii infected mainly delphinids; A. physeteris and A. brevispiculata were present only in physeterids, and A. ziphidarum occurred in ziphiids. The role of cetacean host populations from different waters in shaping the population genetic structure of A. simplex (s.s.), A. pegreffii and A. physeteris was investigated for the first time. Significant genetic sub-structuring was found in A. simplex (s.s.) populations of the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea compared to those of the Iberian Atlantic, as well as in A. pegreffii populations of the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian Seas compared to those of the Iberian Atlantic waters. Substantial genetic homogeneity was detected in the Mediterranean Sea population of A. physeteris. This study highlights a strong preference by some Anisakis spp. for certain cetacean species or families. Information about anisakid biodiversity in their cetacean definitive hosts, which are apex predators of marine ecosystems, acquires particular importance for conservation measures in the context of global climate change phenomena.

Direct effects include ecosystem stress due to natural resources shortage or imbalance. Indirect effects include (i) an increased frequency of natural detrimental phenomena, (ii) an increased pressure due to already present pests and diseases, (iii) the introduction of new invasive species either as a result of an improved suitability of the climatic conditions or as a result of increased trade, and (iv) the human response to global change. In this review, we provide an overview of recent studies on terrestrial plant health in the presence of global change factors. We summarize the links between climate change and some key issues in plant health, including tree mortality, changes in wildfire regimes, biological invasions and the role of genetic diversity for ecosystem resilience. Prediction and management of global change effects are complicated by interactions between globalization, climate and invasive plants and/or pathogens. We summarize practical guidelines for landscape management and draw general conclusions from an expanding body of literature.

J	Patil, RR; Kumar, CS; Bagvandas, M				Patil, Rajan R.; Kumar, Ch. Satish; Bagvandas, M.			Biodiversity loss: Public health risk of disease spread and epidemics	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH				Review								Background: Biodiversity and human health are intimately linked to each other, human beings are an integral and inseparable part of the natural ecosystem as human health depends ultimately on the health of its species. Human interference with biodiversity affects ecosystem both structurally and functionally, consequently biodiversity is continuously declining globally Objective: The objective of this study is to understand the effect of biodiversity loss on dynamics of infectious disease transmission and its impact on the magnitude and impact of epidemics. Methods: This is a literature review. Discussion: Correlation has been observed between decrease in disease frequency with increase in biodiversity. A region rich in diversity of species of vertebrates has protective effect against vulnerability of Infectious diseases especially Vector-borne zoonotic diseases. This phenomenon in nature is known as Dilution effect. Biodiversity in host can either lead to amplification or buffering of epidemics. Dilution effect lowers the incidence of the disease among humans while the richness of biodiversity reduces the prevalence of directly transmitted diseases leading to buffering effect. Fragmentation of natural habitat leads to lowered biodiversity leads to higher risk of exposure to diseases. Conclusion: While some human health effects due to biodiversity loss may be direct and easily perceptible while others are indirect may not be appreciated currently. According to the World Health Organization, the adverse health effects brought in by loss of biodiversity far exceeds dangers of implication of climate change to human health. Health professionals should advocate for the preservation of biodiversity as it has a powerful impact on frequency of disease transmission in the community.	[Patil, Rajan R.; Kumar, Ch.

Effects of individual, community, and landscape drivers on the dynamics of a wildland forest epidemic	ECOLOGY				Article								The challenges posed by observing host-pathogen-environment interactions across large geographic extents and over meaningful time scales limit our ability to understand and manage wildland epidemics. We conducted a landscape-scale, longitudinal study designed to analyze the dynamics of sudden oak death (an emerging forest disease caused by Phytophthora ramorum) across hierarchical levels of ecological interactions, from individual hosts up to the community and across the broader landscape. From 2004 to 2011, we annually assessed disease status of 732 coast live oak, 271 black oak, and 122 canyon live oak trees in 202 plots across a 275-km(2) landscape in central California. The number of infected oak stems steadily increased during the eight-year study period. Asurvival analysis modeling framework was used to examine which level of ecological heterogeneity best predicted infection risk of susceptible oak species, considering variability at the level of individuals (species identity, stem size), the community (host density, inoculum load, and species richness), and the landscape (seasonal climate variability, habitat connectivity, and topographic gradients). After accounting for unobserved risk shared among oaks in the same plot, survival models incorporating heterogeneity across all three levels better predicted oak infection than did models focusing on only one level. We show that larger oak trees (especially coast live oak) were more susceptible, and that interannual variability in inoculum production by the highly infectious reservoir host, California bay laurel, more strongly influenced disease risk than simply the density of this important host. Concurrently, warmer and wetter rainy-season conditions in consecutive years intensified infection risk, presumably by creating a longer period of inoculum build-up and increased probability of pathogen spillover from bay laurel to oaks. Despite the presence of many alternate host species, we found evidence of pathogen dilution, where less competent hosts in species-rich communities reduce pathogen transmission and overall risk of oak infection.These results identify key parameters driving the dynamics of emerging infectious disease in California woodlands, while demonstrating how multiple levels of ecological heterogeneity jointly determine epidemic trajectories in wildland settings.

At the same time, forest landscape restoration has regained global attention as an integral strategy for climate change mitigation. Owing to unpredictable future risks and the need for new forests that provide multiple ecosystem services, mixed-species forests have been advocated for this purpose. However, the successful establishment of mixed forests requires intrinsic knowledge of biodiversity's role for forest ecosystem functioning. In this respect, a better understanding of tree-tree interactions and how they contribute to observed positive tree species richness effects on key ecosystem functions is critical. Here, we review the current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of treetree interactions and argue that positive net biodiversity effects at the community scale may emerge from the dominance of positive over negative interactions at the local neighbourhood scale. In a second step, we demonstrate how tree-tree interactions and the immediate tree neighbourhood's role can be systematically assessed in a tree diversity experiment. The expected results will improve predictions about the effects of tree interactions on ecosystem functioning based on general principles.

This study aimed to find association between content of disease followed climate change we demonstrate in humans. Methods: All the articles from 2016 to 2021 associated with global climate change and the effect of vectorborne disease were selected form databases including PubMed and the Global Biodiversity information facility database. All the articles selected for this short review were English. Results: Due to the high burden of infectious diseases and the growing evidence of the possible effects of climate change on the incidence of these diseases, these climate changes can potentially be involved with the COVID- 19 epidemic. We highlighted the evidence of vector-borne diseases and the possible effects of climate change on these communicable diseases. Conclusion: Climate change, specifically in rising temperature system is one of the world's greatest concerns already affected pathogen-vector and host relation. Lice parasitic, fleas, mites, ticks, and mosquitos are the prime public health importance in the transmission of virus to human hosts.

J	Sutherst, RW				Sutherst, RW			Implications of global change and climate variability for vectorborne diseases: generic approaches to impact assessments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Australian-Society-for-Parasitology	JUL 14-18, 1997	AUSTR NATL UNIV, CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA		AUSTR NATL UNIV			Global change is pervasive and occurring at a dramatic rate. It involves changes in land use, vegetation cover, species translocations and even the climate of the planet. The consequences for the biosphere are uncertain. Past research emphasis has been on the science of climate change as the major driver of policy. The present priority in the global-change community is to define the likely nature and extent of those impacts on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. In addition, increasing consideration is now being given to adaptation measures. The way in which that is being initiated is to develop adaptation measures to respond to medium-term climate variability in the form of altered El Nino and similar cycles, and changes in the frequency of extreme events. Given the large number of stakeholders in agriculture, human health and the environment, there is a need for great efficiencies if the scientific community is going to be able to respond in a meaningful way with foreseeable resources. The plethora of problems means that generic approaches are needed. The present situation, with parasitologists each doing their own thing in terms of developing and using software tools, is like the tower of Babel. Parasitologists need common tools and languages to facilitate communication and collaboration. Advances in computing, with object-oriented programming languages and seamless exchange of information between different packages and platforms, are providing some exciting opportunities to overcome these problems.

This review discussed recent developments in plant pathology research and identifies some key issues that, we anticipate, must be faced to meet the food security and environmental challenges that will arise over coming decades. In meeting these issues, the challenge in turn is for the plant pathology community to respond by contributing to a wider forum for multidisciplinary research, recognising that impact will depend not just on advances in the plant pathology discipline alone, but on interactions more broadly with other agricultural and ecological sciences, and with the needs of national and global policies and regulation. A challenge more readily met once plant pathologists again gather physically at international meetings and return to the professional and social encounters that are fertile grounds for developing new ideas and forging collaborative approaches both within plant pathology and with other disciplines. In this review we emphasise, in particular: the multidisciplinary links between plant pathology and other disciplines; disease management, including precision agriculture, plant growth and development, and decision analysis and disease risk; the development and use of new and novel plant protection chemicals; new ways of exploiting host genetic diversity including host resistance deployment; a new perspective on biological control and microbial interactions; advances in surveillance and detection technologies; invasion of exotic and re-emerging plant pathogens; and the consequences of climate change affecting all aspects of agriculture, the environment, and their interactions. We draw conclusions in each of these areas, but in reaching forward over the next few decades, these inevitably lead to further research questions rather than solutions to the challenges we anticipate.

J	Wake, DB; Vredenburg, VT				Wake, David B.; Vredenburg, Vance T.			Are we in the midst of the sixth mass extinction? A view from the world of amphibians	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				Article								Many scientists argue that we are either entering or in the midst of the sixth great mass extinction. Intense human pressure, both direct and indirect, is having profound effects on natural environments. The amphibians-frogs, salamanders, and caecilians-may be the only major group currently at risk globally. A detailed worldwide assessment and subsequent updates show that one-third or more of the 6,300 species are threatened with extinction. This trend is likely to accelerate because most amphibians occur in the tropics and have small geographic ranges that make them susceptible to extinction. The increasing pressure from habitat destruction and climate change is likely to have major impacts on narrowly adapted and distributed species. We show that salamanders on tropical mountains are particularly at risk. A new and significant threat to amphibians is a virulent, emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which appears to be globally distributed, and its effects may be exacerbated by global warming. This disease, which is caused by a fungal pathogen and implicated in serious declines and extinctions of > 200 species of amphibians, poses the greatest threat to biodiversity of any known disease. Our data for frogs in the Sierra Nevada of California show that the fungus is having a devastating impact on native species, already weakened by the effects of pollution and introduced predators. A general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction.

J	Smallbone, W; Cable, J; Maceda-Veiga, A				Smallbone, Willow; Cable, Jo; Maceda-Veiga, Alberto			Chronic nitrate enrichment decreases severity and induces protection against an infectious disease	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL				Article								Excessive fertilisation is one of the most pernicious forms of global change resulting in eutrophication. It has major implications for disease control and the conservation of biodiversity. Yet, the direct link between nutrient enrichment and disease remains largely unexplored. Here, we present the first experimental evidence that chronic nitrate enrichment decreases severity and induces protection against an infectious disease. Specifically, this study shows that nitrate concentrations ranging between 50 and 250 mg NO3-/l reduce Gyrodactylus turnbulli infection intensity in two populations of Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata, and that the highest nitrate concentration can even clean the parasites from the fish. This added to the fact that host nitrate pre-exposure altered the fish epidermal structure and reduced parasite intensity, suggests that nitrate protected the host against the disease. Nitrate treatments also caused fish mortality. As we used ecologically-relevant nitrate concentrations, and guppies are top-consumers widely used for mosquito bio-control in tropical and often nutrient-enriched waters, our results can have major ecological and social implications. In conclusion, this study advocates reducing nitrate level including the legislative threshold to protect the aquatic biota, even though this may control an ectoparasitic disease.

It is a global threat that has embarked on to put stress on various sectors. This study is aimed to conceptually engineer how climate variability is deteriorating the sustainability of diverse sectors worldwide. Specifically, the agricultural sector's vulnerability is a globally concerning scenario, as sufficient production and food supplies are threatened due to irreversible weather fluctuations. In turn, it is challenging the global feeding patterns, particularly in countries with agriculture as an integral part of their economy and total productivity. Climate change has also put the integrity and survival of many species at stake due to shifts in optimum temperature ranges, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss by progressively changing the ecosystem structures. Climate variations increase the likelihood of particular food and waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and a recent example is a coronavirus pandemic. Climate change also accelerates the enigma of antimicrobial resistance, another threat to human health due to the increasing incidence of resistant pathogenic infections. Besides, the global tourism industry is devastated as climate change impacts unfavorable tourism spots. The methodology investigates hypothetical scenarios of climate variability and attempts to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate readers' careful, critical engagement. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability issues such as environmental, social, and economic viability. To better understand the problem, gathered the information in this report from various media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers, and other sources. This review is a sectorial assessment of climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches worldwide in the aforementioned sectors and the associated economic costs. According to the findings, government involvement is necessary for the country's long-term development through strict accountability of resources and regulations implemented in the past to generate cutting-edge climate policy. Therefore, mitigating the impacts of climate change must be of the utmost importance, and hence, this global threat requires global commitment to address its dreadful implications to ensure global sustenance.

Climate change, fisheries, and aquaculture: trends and consequences for Canadian marine biodiversity	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS				Review								Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have affected and will continue to influence Canadian marine biodiversity, albeit at different spatial scales. The Arctic is notably affected by reduced quality and quantity of sea ice caused by global warming, and by concomitant and forecasted changes in ocean productivity, species ecology, and human activity. The Atlantic has been especially impacted by severe overfishing and human-induced alterations to food webs. Climate change, fishing, and aquaculture have all affected, to varying degrees, biodiversity on Canada's Pacific coast. Past and projected trends in key biodiversity stressors reveal marked change. Oceanographic trends include increasing surface water temperatures, reduced salinity, increased acidity, and, in some areas, reduced oxygen. Reductions in Canada's fishery catches (those in 2009 were half those of the late 1980s), followed by reductions in fishing pressure, are associated with dramatic changes in the species composition of commercial catches in the Atlantic (formerly groundfish, now predominantly invertebrates and pelagic fish) and the Pacific (formerly salmon, now predominantly groundfish). Aquaculture, dominated by the farming of Atlantic salmon, grew rapidly from the early 1980s until 2002 and has since stabilized. Climate change is forecast to affect marine biodiversity by shifting species distributions, changing species community composition, decoupling the timing of species' resource requirements and resource availability, and reducing habitat quality. Harvest-related reductions in fish abundance, many by 80% or more, coupled with fishing-induced changes to food webs, are impairing the capacity of species to recover or even persist. Open-sea aquaculture net pens affect biodiversity by (i) habitat alteration resulting from organic wastes, chemical inputs, and use of nonnative species; (ii) exchange of pathogens between farmed and wild species; and (iii) interbreeding between wild fish and farmed escapees. Physical and biological changes in the oceans, along with direct anthropogenic impacts, are modifying Canadian marine biodiversity with implications for food security and the social and economic well-being of coastal communities. To assess the consequences of changes in biodiversity for Canada's oceans and society, it is necessary to understand the current state of marine biodiversity and how it might be affected by projected changes in climate and human uses.

J	Clark, NJ				Clark, Nicholas J.			Phylogenetic uniqueness, not latitude, explains the diversity of avian blood parasite communities worldwide	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY				Article								Aim: Characterizing macroecological patterns in biodiversity is key to improve our understanding of community assembly. Global biodiversity for many taxa follows a latitudinal gradient, with increased diversity in tropical latitudes. Less is known about global parasite biodiversity, inhibiting our ability to predict how global change will impact parasitic disease emergence. Using distribution and phylogenetic data for 2,386 avian haemosporidian blood parasites (genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon), I assessed how contemporary and historical drivers influence the composition of parasite communities worldwide. Location: Global. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Haemosporidian blood parasites. Methods: Parasite distribution and cytochromeb sequence data were accessed from an open-source database. Bayesian phylogenetic tree distributions were constructed for each parasite genus using two substitution models to capture uncertainty. Hierarchical regressions assessed effects of environmental variation, latitude and phylogenetic-beta-diversity (beta(div); a proxy for phylogenetic uniqueness) on the diversity and asymmetry of parasite communities around the globe. Results: I uncovered biodiversity hotspots and identified broad variation in global diversity patterns among parasite genera. Community diversity increased with increasing phylogenetic uniqueness for all three parasite genera; however, these diverse and unique regions did not consistently occur in the tropics. I found no evidence of a latitudinal diversity gradient, and support for a latitudinal gradient in community phylogenetic asymmetry was weak. Main conclusions: Global variation in avian haemosporidian phylogenetic diversity does not reflect a latitudinal gradient. Instead, parasite biogeography may reflect fundamental differences in host-switching tendencies or the timing of avian evolutionary radiations. Examining the interplay between shared evolutionary history and phylogenetic diversity can provide important insights into the drivers of parasite biodiversity at global scales.

In this era, terrestrial ecosystems are experiencing perturbations linked to direct habitat modifications as well as indirect effects of global change on species distribution and extreme abiotic conditions. Microorganisms represent an important reservoir of biodiversity that can influence macro-organisms as they face habitat loss, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, pollution, global warming, and increased frequency of drought. Plant-microbe interactions in the phyllosphere have been shown to support plant growth and increase host resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we review how plant-microbe interactions in the phyllosphere can influence host survival and fitness in the context of global change. We highlight evidence that plant-microbe interactions (1) improve urban pollution remediation through the degradation of pollutants such as ultrafine particulate matter, black carbon, and atmospheric hydrocarbons, (2) have contrasting impacts on plant species range shifts through the loss of symbionts or pathogens, and (3) drive plant host adaptation to drought and warming. Finally, we discuss how key community ecology processes could drive plant-microbe interactions facing challenges of the Anthropocene.

Reduced parasite diversity and abundance in a marine whelk in its expanded geographical range	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY				Article								Aim To improve our understanding of how parasitism interacts with geographical range expansions by quantifying diversity and abundance of parasites in 25 populations of a large marine snail, Kellet's whelk (Kelletia kelletii), throughout its historical and recently expanded range, which are separated by a well-known biogeographical boundary. Location California coast (western North America). Methods Parasitological examinations were conducted on 199 whelks from 25 subtidal reefs throughout its expanded and historical ranges. We calculated infection risk, parasite intensity, and parasite species diversity. Abiotic (temperature, latitude, distance from range limit) and biotic (host density) variables were analysed as potential drivers of differential parasitism between expanded- and historical-range populations. Results Compared with historical-range whelks, expanded-range whelks were 20% as likely to be infected by parasites, and those that were infected had 6% the number of individual parasites. On average, expanded-range whelks had 14% the number of parasite species than the historical-range whelks. The marked decrease in species richness of parasites infecting expanded-range whelks was only partly explained by the low numbers of parasites. The reduced parasite abundance and diversity in the expanded-range whelks was not explained by the examined abiotic factors or by whelk density. Main conclusions Expanded-range populations of Kellet's whelk experience substantially lower parasite abundance and diversity than the historical-range populations, despite relatively poor demographic performance. The reduced parasitism observed resembles the enemy escape typically characterizing invasive species. A possible explanation for the observed 'parasite escape' is that the biogeographical boundary limits the movements or drives the low abundance of other host species (elasmobranchs) required to complete the life cycles of the 'missing' parasites. We suggest that parasite escape may generally characterize range-margin expansions and be important in permitting expansions into what may otherwise be marginal habitats. This parasite escape may directly counter the spread of infectious diseases associated with global warming-induced range shifts.

Interacting effects of land use and climate on rodent-borne pathogens in central Kenya	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								Understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on zoonotic disease risk is both a critical conservation objective and a public health priority. Here, we evaluate the effects of multiple forms of anthropogenic disturbance across a precipitation gradient on the abundance of pathogen-infected small mammal hosts in a multi-host, multi-pathogen system in central Kenya. Our results suggest that conversion to cropland and wildlife loss alone drive systematic increases in rodent-borne pathogen prevalence, but that pastoral conversion has no such systematic effects. The effects are most likely explained both by changes in total small mammal abundance, and by changes in relative abundance of a few high-competence species, although changes in vector assemblages may also be involved. Several pathogens responded to interactions between disturbance type and climatic conditions, suggesting the potential for synergistic effects of anthropogenic disturbance and climate change on the distribution of disease risk. Overall, these results indicate that conservation can be an effective tool for reducing abundance of rodent-borne pathogens in some contexts (e.g. wildlife loss alone); however, given the strong variation in effects across disturbance types, pathogen taxa and environmental conditions, the use of conservation as public health interventions will need to be carefully tailored to specific pathogens and human contexts. This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.

J.; Maria Carrascal, Luis			Long-term monitoring of an amphibian community after a climate change- and infectious disease-driven species extirpation	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Infectious disease and climate change are considered major threats to biodiversity and act as drivers behind the global amphibian decline. This is, to a large extent, based on short-term studies that are designed to detect the immediate and strongest biodiversity responses to a threatening process. What few long-term studies are available, although typically focused on single species, report outcomes that often diverge significantly from the short-term species responses. Here, we report the results of an 18-year survey of an amphibian community exposed to both climate warming and the emergence of lethal chytridiomycosis. Our study shows that the impacts of infectious disease are ongoing but restricted to two out of nine species that form the community, despite the fact all species can become infected with the fungus. Climate warming appears to be affecting four out of the nine species, but the response of three of these is an increase in abundance. Our study supports a decreasing role of infectious disease on the community, and an increasing and currently positive effect of climate warming. We caution that if the warming trends continue, the net positive effect will turn negative as amphibian breeding habitat becomes unavailable as water bodies dry, a pattern that already may be underway.

Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS): Environmental solution and climate change adaptation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				Review								Considering environmental sustainability and vulnerability to the effects of climate change on fish production, one of the potential adaptation strategies is "Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS)". RAS are eco-friendly, water efficient, highly productive intensive farming system, which are not associated with adverse environmental impacts, such as habitat destruction, water pollution and eutrophication, biotic depletion, ecological effects on biodiversity due to captive fish and exotic species escape, disease outbreaks, and parasite transmission. Moreover, RAS operate in indoor controlled environment, and thus, only minimally affected by climatic factors, including rainfall variation, flood, drought, global warming, cyclone, salinity fluctuation, ocean acidification, and sea level rise. However, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the two most stringent limiting factors for RAS. Despite these potentials and promises, RAS have not yet been widely practiced, particularly in developing countries, due to complex and costly system designs. Further research with technological innovations are needed to establish low-cost, energy efficient RAS for intensifying seafood production, reducing GHG emissions, and adaptation to climate change.

Plague risk in the western United States over seven decades of environmental change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								After several pandemics over the last two millennia, the wildlife reservoirs of plague (Yersinia pestis) now persist around the world, including in the western United States. Routine surveillance in this region has generated comprehensive records of human cases and animal seroprevalence, creating a unique opportunity to test how plague reservoirs are responding to environmental change. Here, we test whether animal and human data suggest that plague reservoirs and spillover risk have shifted since 1950. To do so, we develop a new method for detecting the impact of climate change on infectious disease distributions, capable of disentangling long-term trends (signal) and interannual variation in both weather and sampling (noise). We find that plague foci are associated with high-elevation rodent communities, and soil biochemistry may play a key role in the geography of long-term persistence. In addition, we find that human cases are concentrated only in a small subset of endemic areas, and that spillover events are driven by higher rodent species richness (the amplification hypothesis) and climatic anomalies (the trophic cascade hypothesis). Using our detection model, we find that due to the changing climate, rodent communities at high elevations have become more conducive to the establishment of plague reservoirs-with suitability increasing up to 40% in some places-and that spillover risk to humans at mid-elevations has increased as well, although more gradually. These results highlight opportunities for deeper investigation of plague ecology, the value of integrative surveillance for infectious disease geography, and the need for further research into ongoing climate change impacts.

Recently, the possibility that elevated temperatures resulting from global warming may substantially affect biodiversity through disrupting mutualistic/parasitic associations has been highlighted. Here we report an experimental demonstration that global warming can affect a pest insect via suppression of its obligate bacterial symbiont. The southern green stinkbug Nezara viridula depends on a specific gut bacterium for its normal growth and survival. When the insects were reared inside or outside a simulated warming incubator wherein temperature was controlled at 2.5 degrees C higher than outside, the insects reared in the incubator exhibited severe fitness defects (i.e., retarded growth, reduced size, yellowish body color, etc.) and significant reduction of symbiont population, particularly in the midsummer season, whereas the insects reared outside did not. Rearing at 30 degrees C or 32.5 degrees C resulted in similar defective phenotypes of the insects, whereas no adult insects emerged at 35 degrees C. Notably, experimental symbiont suppression by an antibiotic treatment also induced similar defective phenotypes of the insects, indicating that the host's defective phenotypes are attributable not to the heat stress itself but to the suppression of the symbiont population induced by elevated temperature. These results strongly suggest that high temperature in the midsummer season negatively affects the insects not directly but indirectly via the heat-vulnerable obligate bacterial symbiont, which highlights the practical relevance of mutualism collapse in this warming world. IMPORTANCE Climate change is among the biggest environmental issues in the contemporary world, and its impact on the biodiversity and ecosystem is not only of scientific interest but also of practical concern for the general public. On the basis of our laboratory data obtained under strictly controlled environmental conditions and our simulated warming data obtained in seminatural settings (elevated 2.5 degrees C above the normal temperature), we demonstrate here that Nezara viridula, the notorious stinkbug pest, suffers serious fitness defects in the summer season under the simulated warming conditions, wherein high temperature acts on the insect not directly but indirectly via suppression of its obligate gut bacterium. Our finding highlights that heat-susceptible symbionts can be the "Achilles' heel" of symbiont-dependent organisms under climate change conditions.

Global Patterns of the Fungal Pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Support Conservation Urgency	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				Article								The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a skin pathogen that can cause the emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis in susceptible species. It has been considered one of the most severe threats to amphibian biodiversity. We aimed to provide an updated compilation of global Bd occurrences by host taxon and geography, and with the larger global Bd dataset we reanalyzed Bd associations with environmental metrics at the world and regional scales. We also compared our Bd data compilation with a recent independent assessment to provide a more comprehensive count of species and countries with Bd occurrences. Bd has been detected in 1,375 of 2,525 (55%) species sampled, more than doubling known species infections since 2013. Bd occurrence is known from 93 of 134 (69%) countries at this writing; this compares to known occurrences in 56 of 82 (68%) countries in 2013. Climate-niche space is highly associated with Bd detection, with different climate metrics emerging as key predictors of Bd occurrence at regional scales; this warrants further assessment relative to climate-change projections. The accretion of Bd occurrence reports points to the common aims of worldwide investigators to understand the conservation concerns for amphibian biodiversity in the face of potential disease threat. Renewed calls for better mitigation of amphibian disease threats resonate across continents with amphibians, especially outside Asia. As Bd appears to be able to infect about half of amphibian taxa and sites, there is considerable room for biosecurity actions to forestall its spread using both bottom-up community-run efforts and top-down national-to-international policies. Conservation safeguards for sensitive species and biodiversity refugia are continuing priorities.

Genetic approaches for increasing fitness in endangered species	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION				Review								The global rate of wildlife extinctions is accelerating, and the persistence of many species requires conservation breeding programs. A central paradigm of these programs is to preserve the genetic diversity of the founder populations. However, this may preserve original characteristics that make them vulnerable to extinction. We introduce targeted genetic intervention (TGI) as an alternative approach that promotes traits that enable species to persist in the face of threats by changing the incidence of alleles that impact on fitness. The TGI toolkit includes methods with established efficacy in model organisms and agriculture but are largely untried for conservation, such as synthetic biology and artificial selection. We explore TGI approaches as a species-restoration tool for intractable threats including infectious disease and climate change.

J	Foley, P; Roth, T; Foley, J; Ray, C				Foley, Patrick; Roth, Tara; Foley, Janet; Ray, Chris			Rodent-Pika Parasite Spillover in Western North America	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY				Article								Competition during the Cenozoic expansion of the Rodentia may have contributed to ecological niche reduction of pikas, which are now increasingly under threat as their habitat degrades under global climate change, while some rodents expand their ranges and overlap with pikas. Range overlap carries the possibility of disease spillover. Contemporary North American pikas are cold-adapted and relegated primarily to alpine environments where they subsist on relatively low-quality herbaceous diet. Yet their evolutionary ancestors were distributed geographically even into the subtropics. Here we examine historical and contemporary records of fleas on pikas (Ochotona princeps) from sites at different elevations in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. We calculated indices of diversity from each site and spillover fraction, i.e., the proportion of fleas on pikas that have a preference for rodents. Across this range there are four pika specialist flea species, with no more than two of these per site, and 18 characteristically rodent flea species. Diversity is greatest in the Pacific Northwest and lowest in Montana. Rodent flea spillover onto pikas declines with elevation in the Rocky Mountains. These data provide evidence that rodents and pikas interact enough to allow considerable parasite spillover, and which could be exacerbated as pikas are increasingly stressed by climate change at lower elevations some rodent species expand up-elevation in the face of increasing global warming. With global climate change, both biotic and abiotic niche shrinkage demand our attention.

ACG's natural ecosystem restoration began with its national park designation in 1971. As human biomonitors, or "insectometers," we see that ACG's insect species richness and density have gradually declined since the late 1970s, and more intensely since about 2005. The overarching perturbation is climate change. It has caused increasing ambient temperatures for all ecosystems; more erratic seasonal cues; reduced, erratic, and asynchronous rainfall; heated air masses sliding up the volcanoes and burning off the cloud forest; and dwindling biodiversity in all ACG terrestrial ecosystems. What then is the next step as climate change descends on ACG's many small-scale successes in sustainable biodevelopment?

The socio-ecology of zoonotic infections	CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION				Review								P>The resurgence of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin observed in recent years imposes a major morbidity/mortality burden worldwide, and also a major economic burden that extends beyond pure medical costs. The resurgence and epidemiology of zoonoses are complex and dynamic, being influenced by varying parameters that can roughly be categorized as human-related, pathogen-related, and climate/environment-related; however, there is significant interplay between these factors. Human-related factors include modern life trends such as ecotourism, increased exposure through hunting or pet owning, and culinary habits, industrialization sequelae such as farming/food chain intensification, globalization of trade, human intrusion into ecosystems and urbanization, significant alterations in political regimes, conflict with accompanying breakdown of public health and surveillance infrastructure, voluntary or involuntary immigration, loosening of border controls, and hierarchy issues in related decision-making, and scientific advances that allow easier detection of zoonotic infections and evolution of novel susceptible immunocompromised populations. Pathogen-related factors include alterations in ecosystems and biodiversity that influence local fauna synthesis, favouring expansion of disease hosts or vectors, pressure for virulence/resistance selection, and genomic variability. Climate/environment-related factors, either localized or extended, such as El Nino southern oscillation or global warming, may affect host-vector life cycles through varying mechanisms. Emerging issues needing clarification include the development of predictive models for the infectious disease impact of environmental projects, awareness of the risk imposed on immunocompromised populations, recognition of the chronicity burden for certain zoonoses, and the development of different evaluations of the overall stress imposed by a zoonotic infection on a household, and not strictly a person.

The genetic diversity of local african chickens: A potential for selection of chickens resistant to viral infections	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				Review								Viral infections impose a great threat to backyard chicken production among poor rural households in developing countries. These infections limit the contribution of chicken production in improving the livelihoods of poor communities, particularly in Africa. Chicken viral infections lack treatment options; control and prevention depend primarily on adoption of vaccines and good farm management practice such as the institution of biosecurity measures. In backyard production systems, these control options are less practical and less feasible to implement. Research has demonstrated the role of genetic diversity of farmed animals and birds in explaining variation in resistance to infectious diseases and suggests that heterogeneous populations are less susceptible to disease than homogeneous populations. Local African chicken ecotypes have high genetic diversity and have demonstrated the ability to survive persistent exposure to pathogens and harsh environmental conditions. This suggests that local African chickens have the genetic potential to enhance breeding strategies for resistance to viral infections. Despite the ongoing threat of infectious disease and dynamic of diseases epidemiology attributed by climate change, little has been done to harness the genetic potential of local African chicken ecotypes to breed for resistant traits. To lay the foundation for future research, this review paper presents a summary of challenges facing current chicken viral infections control and prevention options in local African chickens, and gives an overview of documented information on the genetic diversity and population structure of local African chicken ecotypes.

J	Buras, A; Menzel, A				Buras, Allan; Menzel, Annette			Projecting Tree Species Composition Changes of European Forests for 2061-2090 Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 Scenarios	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				Article								Climate change poses certain threats to the World's forests. That is, tree performance declines if species-specific, climatic thresholds are surpassed. Prominent climatic changes negatively affecting tree performance are mainly associated with so-called hotter droughts. In combination with biotic pathogens, hotter droughts cause a higher tree vulnerability and thus mortality. As a consequence, global forests are expected to undergo vast changes in the course of climate change. Changed climatic conditions may on the one hand locally result in more frequent dieback of a particular tree species but on the other hand allow other-locally yet absent species-to establish themselves, thereby potentially changing local tree-species diversity. Although several studies provide valuable insights into potential risks of prominent European tree species, we yet lack a comprehensive assessment on how and to which extent the composition of European forests may change. To overcome this research gap, we here project future tree-species compositions of European forests. We combine the concept of climate analogs with national forest inventory data to project the tree-species composition for the 26 most important European tree species at any given location in Europe for the period 2061-2090 and the two most relevant CMIP5 scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Our results indicate significant changes in European forests species compositions. Species richness generally declined in the Mediterranean and Central European lowlands, while Scandinavian and Central European high-elevation forests were projected an increasing diversity. Moreover, 76% (RCP 4.5) and 80% (RCP 8.5) of the investigated locations indicated a decreasing abundance of the locally yet most abundant tree species while 74 and 68% were projected an increasing tree-species diversity. Altogether, our study confirms the expectation of European forests undergoing remarkable changes until the end of the 21st century (i.e., 2061-2090) and provides a scientific basement for climate change adaptation with important implications for forestry and nature conservation.

J	Jones, CM; Brown, MJF				Jones, Catherine M.; Brown, Mark J. F.			Parasites and genetic diversity in an invasive bumblebee	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				Article								Biological invasions are facilitated by the global transportation of species and climate change. Given that invasions may cause ecological and economic damage and pose a major threat to biodiversity, understanding the mechanisms behind invasion success is essential. Both the release of non-native populations from natural enemies, such as parasites, and the genetic diversity of these populations may play key roles in their invasion success. We investigated the roles of parasite communities, through enemy release and parasite acquisition, and genetic diversity in the invasion success of the non-native bumblebee, Bombus hypnorum, in the United Kingdom. The invasive B.hypnorum had higher parasite prevalence than most, or all native congeners for two high-impact parasites, probably due to higher susceptibility and parasite acquisition. Consequently parasites had a higher impact on B.hypnorum queens' survival and colony-founding success than on native species. Bombus hypnorum also had lower functional genetic diversity at the sex-determining locus than native species. Higher parasite prevalence and lower genetic diversity have not prevented the rapid invasion of the United Kingdom by B.hypnorum. These data may inform our understanding of similar invasions by commercial bumblebees around the world. This study suggests that concerns about parasite impacts on the small founding populations common to re-introduction and translocation programs may be less important than currently believed.

This could be attributed to the internal diversion of energy resources towards adaptive mechanisms. Among the climate change variables, thermal stress seems to be the major limiting factor in animal agriculture. A better understanding of the effects of climate change-influenced ecological factors on the genetic diversity of livestock species is warranted. Sheep is an ideal livestock species to be used in investigating environmental adaptation due to its wide range of agroecological habitats, genetic and phenotypic variability. There is a heavy reliance on sheep genetic diversity for future animal protein security, but the implications of climate change on their genetic diversity receive less attention. Here, the potential environmental factors influencing natural selection in sheep populations are presented. We argue that prolonged exposure to these factors plays a major role in influencing the development of adaptation traits in indigenous sheep breeds, consequently leading to the alteration of genetic diversity at specific loci. The factors discussed include hot temperatures (heat stress), insufficient water, low quantity and quality of forage, and prevalence of parasites, pests, and diseases. In addition, genetic diversity, some signatures of selection for adaptation and economic angles of selection are also briefly discussed. A better understanding of environmental factors influencing the genetic diversity of sheep populations will inform breeding and management programs and may offer an opportunity for greater production efficiency with low input costs.

J	Rossati, A				Rossati, Antonella			Global Warming and Its Health Impact	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE				Review								Since the mid-19th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.

J	Dantas-Torres, F				Dantas-Torres, Filipe			Climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases: The butterfly effect	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE				Article								We have killed wild animals for obtaining food and decimated forests for many reasons. Nowadays, we are burning fossil fuels as never before and even exploring petroleum in deep waters. The impact of these activities on our planet is now visible to the naked eye and the debate on climate change is warming up in scientific meetings and becoming a priority on the agenda of both scientists and policy decision makers. On the occasion of the Impact of Environmental Changes on Infectious Diseases (IECID) meeting, held in the 2015 in Sitges, Spain, I was invited to give a keynote talk on climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases. The aim of the present article is to logically extend my rationale presented on the occasion of the IECID meeting. This article is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but an essay on climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases. It may be anticipated that warmer winters and extended autumn and spring seasons will continue to drive the expansion of the distribution of some tick species (e. g., Ixodes ricinus) to northern latitudes and to higher altitudes. Nonetheless, further studies are advocated to improve our understanding of the complex interactions between landscape, climate, host communities (biodiversity), tick demography, pathogen diversity, human demography, human behaviour, economics, and politics, also considering all ecological processes (e. g., trophic cascades) and other possible interacting effects (e. g., mutual effects of increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased deforestation rates). The multitude of variables and interacting factors involved, and their complexity and dynamism, make tick-borne transmission systems beyond (current) human comprehension. That is, perhaps, the main reason for our inability to precisely predict new epidemics of vectorborne diseases in general. (C) 2015 The Author.

J	Tompkins, DM; Gleeson, DM				Tompkins, D. M.; Gleeson, D. M.			Relationship between avian malaria distribution and an exotic invasive mosquito in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND				Article								Although the mosquito vector responsible for the epizootic outbreaks of avian malaria in Hawaiian avifauna, Culex quinquelasciatus, has spread rapidly in New Zealand over the past three decades, no survey for malarial parasites has been conducted for more than 50 years. Avian malaria often causes extreme morbidity and mortality in novel hosts, and much of New Zealand's native avifauna has likely had no prior exposure, so the impact of this spread on native biodiversity is potentially serious. Wild non-native birds were surveyed for malarial parasites at multiple locations, to test the hypothesis that the prevalence of malarial infection is associated positively with the known distribution of C. quinquefasciatus. Blood samples collected were analysed using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. There was a strong pattern of decreasing percentage of samples positive for the blood parasite PCR marker from north to south, closely matching the known distribution of C. quinquelasciatus. A subsample of 10 PCR products were sequenced, and all identified as the malarial parasite Plasmodium relictum. Since historical surveys found no malarial parasites in the New Zealand avifauna, with a few minor exceptions, this suggests that this invasive exotic vector may be one factor driving the emergence of avian malaria. Sampling of wild non-native birds at Orana Park, Christchurch, where a disease outbreak occurred recently in a captive native bird population, suggested that such outbreaks may spill-back into local wild bird populations. The high prevalence of malarial infection observed in certain non-native species, particularly blackbirds, indicates that they may act as reservoirs of infection to native species.

J	Miller, E; Huppert, A				Miller, Ezer; Huppert, Amit			The Effects of Host Diversity on Vector-Borne Disease: The Conditions under Which Diversity Will Amplify or Dilute the Disease Risk	PLOS ONE				Article								Multihost vector-borne infectious diseases form a significant fraction of the global infectious disease burden. In this study we explore the relationship between host diversity, vector behavior, and disease risk. To this end, we have developed a new dynamic model which includes two distinct host species and one vector species with variable preferences. With the aid of the model we were able to compute the basic reproductive rate, R-0, a well-established measure of disease risk that serves as a threshold parameter for disease outbreak. The model analysis reveals that the system has two different qualitative behaviors: (i) the well-known dilution effect, where the maximal R-0 is obtained in a community which consists a single host (ii) a new amplification effect, denoted by us as diversity amplification, where the maximal R-0 is attained in a community which consists both hosts. The model analysis extends on previous results by underlining the mechanism of both, diversity amplification and the dilution, and specifies the exact conditions for their occurrence. We have found that diversity amplification occurs where the vector prefers the host with the highest transmission ability, and dilution is obtained when the vector does not show any preference, or it prefers to bite the host with the lower transmission ability. The mechanisms of dilution and diversity amplification are able to account for the different and contradictory patterns often observed in nature (i.e., in some cases disease risk is increased while in other is decreased when the diversity is increased). Implication of the diversity amplification mechanism also challenges current premises about the interaction between biodiversity, climate change, and disease risk and calls for retrospective thinking in planning intervention policies aimed at protecting the preferred host species.

J	Koprivnikar, J; Leung, TLF				Koprivnikar, Janet; Leung, Tommy L. F.			Flying with diverse passengers: greater richness of parasitic nematodes in migratory birds	OIKOS				Article								Environmental changes are simultaneously affecting parasitic diseases and animal migrations, making it important to understand the disease dynamics of migratory species, including their range of infections and investment into defences. There is an urgent need for such knowledge because migratory animals, especially birds, are important for pathogen transmission and also particularly sensitive to environmental changes. Here we compare the nematode species richness and relative immune investment (via relative spleen size) of almost 200 migratory and non-migratory species within three diverse groups of birds (Anseriformes, Accipitriformes and Turdidae) with worldwide distributions and varied ecology. Our results provide the first large-scale demonstration that migratory birds face greater challenge from macroparasites as they have significantly dissimilar nematode fauna and higher nematode species richness compared to non-migratory species. Even though birds with relatively large spleens had more nematode species, there was no difference in relative spleen size between migratory and non-migratory bird species. The physiological stress of migration can be exacerbated by the potential range of pathologies induced by their richer nematode communities, particularly in combination with environmental perturbations. Altered migration stemming from global changes can also have important consequences for nematode transmission. Synthesis Most studies on parasites of migratory birds versus non-migratory birds focus upon blood parasites; here we compared the diversity of another important parasite group - nematodes (roundworms) in three orders of birds. We found for any given order, migratory species and species with proportionally larger spleens generally have a wider range of nematodes. It is unclear why migratory species harbour more nematode species. Global climate change is expected to influence both bird migration patterns and infectious diseases, which may increase host susceptibility to parasitism and also introduce diverse nematodes to new areas and potential hosts.

Although this hypothesis has been broadly supported by nutrient enrichment experiments, its applicability to other ecological factors, such as natural enemies and abiotic stresses, has not been vigorously tested. Here, we examined the generality of the niche dimension hypothesis by experimentally manipulating both resource and non-resource niche dimensions-nitrogen limitation, pathogens and low-temperature stress-in a Tibetan alpine meadow. We found that decreases in niche dimensions led to a significant reduction in species richness, consistent with results from nutrient addition studies. However, different niche variables uniquely affected the plant communities. While nitrogen had largest effects on both community biomass and species richness, pathogens and low-temperature stress, in combination with nitrogen, had synergistic effects on them. Our results provide direct evidence demonstrating that both resource and non-resource niche dimensions can influence species coexistence. These findings suggest that other non-resource factors need to be taken into consideration to better predict the community assembly and control over biodiversity, particularly under the future multifaceted global change scenarios.

Explaining Variation in Abundance and Species Diversity of Avian Cestodes in Brine Shrimps in the Salar de Atacama and Other Chilean Wetlands	WATER				Article								Further biogeographical studies of parasites are vital to improve our understanding of biodiversity distribution and predict the impacts of global change. Hypersaline lakes are good laboratories to investigate the avian cestode abundance and species diversity given the abundance of hosts (waterbirds and Artemia) and their broad latitudinal distribution. We analysed cestode infection in brine shrimp Artemia franciscana in northern (Atacama) and central Chile and compared them to results from A. persimilis in southern Chile (Patagonia). Thus, we covered a broad latitudinal gradient from 23 degrees to 53 degrees S. Five cestode taxa including two species of the genus Flamingolepis, Gynandrotaenia stammeri, Eurycestus avoceti, and Fuhrmannolepis averini were recorded from A. franciscana in Atacama lagoons (prevalence = 4.1%). In contrast, no cestode infection was detected in central Chile, likely because they are temporary wetlands. Parasites of flamingos and shorebirds were associated with Atacama lagoons (arid and higher salinity), while Confluaria podicipina and Fimbriarioides sp. (parasites of grebes and ducks, respectively) were dominant in Patagonian lagoons (sub-antarctic and of lower salinity). These differences mirror changes in the relative abundance of the respective final hosts. The flamingo parasite Flamingolepis sp. 1 was the most prevalent and abundant cestode in Atacama, where it was recorded only in autumn. Seasonality and habitat effects (especially abundance and phenology of different bird species) appear to override any latitudinal trends in the prevalence, diversity, and distribution of cestodes. Cestode prevalence was higher in larger wetlands but was not related to the sex of either intermediate host. We recorded a greater taxonomic richness at the cestode family level in Atacama, but a greater dominance of a single family of avian hosts (the flamingos). Ours is the first spatio-temporal study of Artemia cestodes at local and regional scales in the southern hemisphere.

These changes predict the identities of winners and losers of future global change, and also reveal which environmental variables drive a taxon's response to land use change. We explored how the biodiversity of native bee species changes across forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. We collected bee community data from 36 sites across a 75,000 km(2) region, and analyzed bee abundance, species richness, composition, and life-history traits. Season-long bee abundance and richness were not detectably different between natural and anthropogenic landscapes, but community phenologies differed strongly, with an early spring peak followed by decline in forests, and a more extended summer season in agricultural and urban habitats. Bee community composition differed significantly between all three land use types, as did phylogenetic composition. Anthropogenic land use had negative effects on the persistence of several life-history strategies, including early spring flight season and brood parasitism, which may indicate adaptation to conditions in forest habitat. Overall, anthropogenic communities are not diminished subsets of contemporary natural communities. Rather, forest species do not persist in anthropogenic habitats, but are replaced by different native species and phylogenetic lineages preadapted to open habitats. Characterizing compositional and functional differences is crucial for understanding land use as a global change driver across large regional scales.

Design/methodology/approach - This chapter is based on the available literature related to climate change and its effect on animal health and production from different points. The causes and change forcers of climate change, direct and indirect effects of the change on animal health management, host - pathogen - vector interaction, and zoonotic diseases are included. Inter-linkage between climate change and One-Health program are also assessed. Findings - Beside natural causes of climatic change, greenhouse gases are increasing due to human activities, causing global climate changes which have direct and indirect animal health and production performance impacts. The direct impacts are increased ambient temperature, floods, and droughts, while the indirect are reduced availability of water and food. The change and effect also promote diseases spread, increase survival and availability of the pathogen and its intermediate vector host, responsible for distribution and prevalence of tremendous zoonotic, infectious, and vector-borne diseases. The adverse effect on the biodiversity, distribution of animals and micro flora, genetic makeup of microbials which may lead to emerging and re-emerging disease and their outbreaks make the strong linkage between climate change and One-Health. Practical implications - Global climate change is receiving increasing international attention where international organizations are increasing their focus on tackling the health impacts. Thus, there is a need for parallel mitigation of climate change and animal diseases in a global form. Originality/value - Most research on climate change is limited to environmental protection, however this chapter provides a nexus between climate change, animal health, livestock production, and the One-Health program for better livelihood.

Accordingly, there is a growing body of scientific literature available which includes review articles on specific types of biotic interactions. However, up to date there is no review, which summarizes insights on biotic interactions on a global scale and across ecosystems and species. We derived major findings concerning climate change effects on biotic interactions from a formalized literature search in the ISI Web of Science. Increased carbon dioxide levels along with global warming appear to be the most influential factors for the alteration of biotic interactions including, e.g., competition and facilitation, herbivory and pollination, mycorrhiza, parasitism, mutualism, as well as predator-prey interaction. Ecosystems holding large trophic networks and high biodiversity prove to be more resistant towards the effects of climate change than ecosystems disturbed by human influences. Regarding study location, most research up to date is carried out in terrestrial temperate regions, thus proving a strong bias in knowledge sources. The most investigated interaction partners are herbivore insects interacting with grass species. It is often found that indirect effects of altered biotic interactions due to environmental changes on the performance of members of biocoenoses are more pronounced than direct effects of abiotic drivers. With respect to abiotic factors the focus of most investigation is an increase in temperature. Far less data are available on effects of extreme weather events such as drought, heavy rainfall, late frost, and warm spells. Based on our survey, we propose a shift in research towards more complex types of interactions with multiple interaction partners as well as multifactor climate change scenarios and events.

In this study, we explore the effects of habitat heterogeneity, as determined by variation in host resistance and local temperature, on the evolution of Zymoseptoria tritici by comparing the aggressiveness development of five Z. tritici populations originated from different parts of the world on two wheat cultivars varying in resistance to the pathogen. Our results show that host resistance plays an important role in the evolution of Z. tritici. The pathogen was under weak, constraining selection on a host with quantitative resistance but under a stronger, directional selection on a susceptible host. This difference is consistent with theoretical expectations that suggest that quantitative resistance may slow down the evolution of pathogens and therefore be more durable. Our results also show that local temperature interacts with host resistance in influencing the evolution of the pathogen. When infecting a susceptible host, aggressiveness development of Z. tritici was negatively correlated to temperatures of the original collection sites, suggesting a trade-off between the pathogen's abilities of adapting to higher temperature and causing disease and global warming may have a negative effect on the evolution of pathogens. The finding that no such relationship was detected when the pathogen infected the partially resistant cultivars indicates the evolution of pathogens in quantitatively resistant hosts is less influenced by environments than in susceptible hosts.

J	Larsen, MH; Mouritsen, KN				Larsen, Martin H.; Mouritsen, Kim N.			Temperature-parasitism synergy alters intertidal soft-bottom community structure	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				Article								The abundant amphipod Corophium volutator is an ecosystem engineer in soft-bottom intertidal communities due to its grazing and bioturbation activity. However, the amphipod commonly serves as second intermediate host for detrimental microphallid trematodes. This host parasite association is potentially very sensitive to climate change as the transmission rate of larval trematodes (cercariae) from first intermediate hosts (mud snails) to amphipods, and hence infection intensity-dependent amphipod mortality, generally accelerates with increasing temperature. Given the ecosystem engineering role of C. volutator, we hypothesized that elevated temperature, indirectly through increased parasite-induced amphipod mortality, significantly affects the structure of the surrounding benthic community. To test this, we performed a three-month outdoor mesocosm experiment exposing a natural soft-bottom community of benthic plants and animals to four different treatments: relatively low mean water temperature (18 degrees C) with low (<4%) and high (c. 31%) trematode prevalence in the snail population, and relatively high mean water temperature (22 degrees C) with low and high trematode prevalence. Both temperature and snail parasitism had a significant impact on amphipod abundance and resulted in their almost complete eradication at the warm temperature with high parasitism. Aside from the amphipod hosts, increased temperature affected the abundance of eight faunal species out of 22 in total (36%), whereas increased level of parasitism or the parasite temperature interaction influenced the density of three species (14%). The treatment-determined Corophium abundance played an isolated role for several species, particularly the polychaetes Hediste diversicolor (positive) and Polydora ligni (negative). Regarding primary producers, the overall frequency distribution of 21 species of benthic diatoms differed between all four treatments. Species-specific effects were few and weak, however, and microalgal abundance (chlorophyll-a) was statistically unaffected by treatments, together suggesting a rather resilient plant community towards the experimental perturbations. At the community level, the non-host macrofaunal diversity decreased with temperature in the low parasitism treatments whereas it increased with temperature in the high parasitism treatments. This suggests that sufficiently high levels of parasitism may turn a negative effect of elevated temperature on macrofaunal biodiversity into a positive effect. Hence, our experiment demonstrates that the synergy between parasitism and a relevant temperature increase, e.g. in lieu of climate oscillations or global warming, may have broad ecological consequences for the organization and function of soft-bottom communities, in part through elevated parasite-induced mortality of a central community member.

In the context of global change, modifications in winter conditions may disrupt the seasonal phenology patterns of organisms, modify the synchrony of closely interacting species and lead to unpredictable outcomes at different ecological scales. 2. Parasites are present in almost every food web and their interactions with hosts greatly contribute to ecosystem functioning. Among upper trophic levels of terrestrial ecosystems, insect parasitoids are key components in terms of functioning and species richness. Parasitoids respond to climate change in similar ways to other insects, but their close relationship with their hosts and their particular life cycle - alternating between parasitic and free-living forms - make them special cases. 3. This article reviews of the mechanisms likely to undergo plastic or evolutionary adjustments when exposed to climate change that could modify insect seasonal strategies. Different scenarios are then proposed for the evolution of parasitoid insect seasonal ecology by exploring three anticipated outcomes of climate change: (i) decreased severity of winter cold; (ii) decreased winter duration; and (iii) increased extreme seasonal climatic events and environmental stochasticity. 4. The capacities of insects to adapt to new environmental conditions, either through plasticity or genetic evolution, are highlighted. They may reduce diapause expression, adapt to changing cues to initiate or terminate diapause, increase voltinism, or develop overwintering bet-hedging strategies, but parasitoids' responses will be highly constrained by those of their hosts. 5. Changes in the seasonal ecology of parasitoids may have consequences on host-parasitoid synchrony and population cycles, food-web functioning, and ecosystem services such as biological pest control.

Diverse Viruses Carrying Genes for Microbial Extremotolerance in the Atacama Desert Hyperarid Soil	MSYSTEMS				Article								Viruses play an essential role in shaping microbial community structures and serve as reservoirs for genetic diversity in many ecosystems. In hyperarid desert environments, where life itself becomes scarce and loses diversity, the interactions between viruses and host populations have remained elusive. Here, we resolved host-virus interactions in the soil metagenomes of the Atacama Desert hyperarid core, one of the harshest terrestrial environments on Earth. We show evidence of diverse viruses infecting a wide range of hosts found in sites up to 205 km apart. Viral genomes carried putative extremotolerance features (i.e., spore formation proteins) and auxiliary meta-bolic genes, indicating that viruses could mediate the spread of microbial resilience against environmental stress across the desert. We propose a mutualistic model of host-virus interactions in the hyperarid core where viruses seek protection in microbial cells as lysogens or pseudolysogens, while viral extremotolerance genes aid survival of their hosts. Our results suggest that the host-virus interactions in the Atacama Desert soils are dynamic and complex, shaping uniquely adapted microbiomes in this highly selec-tive and hostile environment. IMPORTANCE Deserts are one of the largest and rapidly expanding terrestrial ecosys-tems characterized by low biodiversity and biomass. The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, previously thought to be devoid of life, is one of the harshest envi-ronments, supporting only scant biomass of highly adapted microbes. While there is growing evidence that viruses play essential roles in shaping the diversity and struc-ture of nearly every ecosystem, very little is known about the role of viruses in de-sert soils, especially where viral contact with viable hosts is significantly reduced. Our results demonstrate that diverse viruses are widely dispersed across the desert, potentially spreading key stress resilience and metabolic genes to ensure host survival. The desertification accelerated by climate change expands both the ecosystem cover and the ecological significance of the desert virome. This study sheds light on the com-plex virus-host interplay that shapes the unique microbiome in desert soils.

J	Aguirre, AA				Aguirre, A. Alonso			Changing Patterns of Emerging Zoonotic Diseases in Wildlife, Domestic Animals, and Humans Linked to Biodiversity Loss and Globalization	ILAR JOURNAL				Review								The fundamental human threats to biodiversity including habitat destruction, globalization, and species loss have led to ecosystem disruptions altering infectious disease transmission patterns, the accumulation of toxic pollutants, and the invasion of alien species and pathogens. To top it all, the profound role of climate change on many ecological processes has affected the inability of many species to adapt to these relatively rapid changes. This special issue, "Zoonotic Disease Ecology: Effects on Humans, Domestic Animals and Wildlife," explores the complex interactions of emerging infectious diseases across taxa linked to many of these anthropogenic and environmental drivers. Selected emerging zoonoses including RNA viruses, Rift Valley fever, trypanosomiasis, Hanta virus infection, and other vector-borne diseases are discussed in detail. Also, coprophagous beetles are proposed as important vectors in the transmission and maintenance of infectious pathogens. An overview of the impacts of climate change in emerging disease ecology within the context of Brazil as a case study is provided. Animal Care and Use Committee requirements were investigated, concluding that ecology journals have low rates of explicit statements regarding the welfare and wellbing of wildlife during experimental studies. Most of the solutions to protect biodiversity and predicting and preventing the next epidemic in humans originating from wildlife are oriented towards the developed world and are less useful for biodiverse, low-income economies. We need the development of regional policies to address these issues at the local level.	[Aguirre, A.

J	Harvey, JA				Harvey, Jeffrey A.			Conserving host-parasitoid interactions in a warming world	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE				Article								Anthropogenic global warming (AGW) represents a major threat to biodiversity at all levels of organization. Attendant changes with climate warming are abiotic effects such as changes in the duration and intensity of precipitation events, wind intensity and heat waves. Most importantly, AGW may unravel food webs by differentially affecting the biology and ecology of species involved in intimate interactions, where reciprocal selection forces are often strong. Amongst insects, plant-herbivoreparasitoid interactions fulfill this criterion, as many herbivores and parasitoids are highly specialized on specific food plants and hosts, respectively. Here, focusing on temperature-related effects of AGW, I discuss several potentially important eco-physiological herbivore and parasitoid responses to high temperatures. These include effects on plant traits such as volatile emissions and primary and secondary metabolism. In turn, how these will impact insect herbivores, their parasitoids, and thus trophic interaction webs is discussed. The possible direct metabolic effects of heat waves on insects are also described. I also argue that climate change does not affect biodiversity independently of other human-mediated environmental threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and overuse of pesticides. Thus, the conservation of multitrophic interactions is critically dependent on reducing the impact of multiple anthropogenic stresses.

A major challenge is the lack of baselines for the diversity and distribution of parasites in Arctic wildlife, especially in the freshwater environment. Here we present the first known estimates of the species diversity and host associations of Diplostomum spp. in sub-Arctic freshwater ecosystems of the Palaearctic. Our analyses integrating different analytical approaches, phylogenies based on mitochondria] and nuclear DNA, estimates of genetic divergence, character-based barcoding, morphological examination, precise detection of microhabitat specialisation and host use, led to the discovery of one described and five putative new species that complete their life-cycles within a fairly narrow geographic area in Iceland. This increases the species richness of Diplostomum in Iceland by 200% and raises the number of molecularly characterised species from the Palaearctic to 17 species. Our results suggest that the diversity of Diplostomum spp. is underestimated globally in the high latitude ecosystems and call for a cautionary approach to pathogen identification in developing the much needed baselines of pathogen diversity that may help detect effects of climate change in the freshwater environment of the sub-Arctic.

Anthropogenic disturbance impacts stand structure and susceptibility of an iconic tree species to an endemic canker pathogen	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				Article								Forest ecosystems characterised by higher tree species diversity have been linked to a reduced susceptibility to pathogens. Conversely, endemic pathogens contribute to forest ecosystem dynamics and process. In the face of global change, however, negative impacts arising from more frequent and severe forest disturbances are increasingly observed. An increase in the susceptibility of Coyymbia calophylla, a keystone tree species of southwest Western Australia, to cankers caused by the endemic fungus Quambalaria coyrecup, has emerged in recent decades. Landscape scale assessment of disease incidence has implicated the predisposing role of anthropogenic disturbance, indicating a need for this to be examined at a finer resolution. We assessed the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the incidence of canker disease caused by Q. coyrecup across a disturbance gradient at 17 forest sites. In addition, we determined the impact of disturbance on tree community composition and stand level structural traits including stem density and stand basal area, and investigated the role of these factors as drivers of canker presence. Canker incidence and associated mortality of C. calophylla increased with anthropogenic disturbance. Disturbed edges showed significantly different overstorey composition from the forest transects. Total stem density increased with increasing disturbance, and disturbed edges contained greater numbers of C. calophylla stems compared to forest transects. There was a much increased basal area of C. calophylla on disturbed edges. Regardless of transect position, an increased incidence of canker resulted on sites with increased C. calophylla basal area. Lastly, increased tree species diversity (as measured by species richness) was associated with decreased canker incidence. We demonstrate that anthropogenic disturbance has altered stand structure and led to an increased susceptibility of C. calophylla to Q. coyrecup, resulting in high disease incidence and mortality of trees on disturbed road edges.

The relationship between physiological stress and wildlife disease: consequences for health and conservation	WILDLIFE RESEARCH				Article								Wildlife populations are under increasing pressure from a variety of threatening processes, ranging from climate change to habitat loss, that can incite a physiological stress response. The stress response influences immune function, with potential consequences for patterns of infection and transmission of disease among and within wildlife, domesticated animals and humans. This is concerning because stress may exacerbate the impact of disease on species vulnerable to extinction, with consequences for biodiversity conservation globally. Furthermore, stress may shape the role of wildlife in the spread of emerging infectious diseases (EID) such as Hendra virus (HeV) and Ebola virus. However, we still have a limited understanding of the influence of physiological stress on infectious disease in wildlife. We highlight key reasons why an improved understanding of the relationship between stress and wildlife disease could benefit conservation, and animal and public health, and discuss approaches for future investigation. In particular, we recommend that increased attention be given to the influence of anthropogenic stressors including climate change, habitat loss and management interventions on disease dynamics in wildlife populations.

Introduction to the sampling designs of the National Ecological Observatory Network Terrestrial Observation System	ECOSPHERE				Article								Global change drivers influence ecological processes at multiple scales and manifest across most of Earth as changes in biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, infectious disease incidence, and ecohydrology. Small-scale investigations provide compelling evidence of specific effects of global change on local systems, but are of limited use in modeling complex ecological processes at continental-to-global scales. Long-term observations distributed across a diversity of habitat types are needed to improve the ability to forecast ecological change at large spatial and temporal scales. This special issue introduces the Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a long-term, continental-scale ecological research platform designed to deliver these large-scale datasets. The TOS measures biodiversity of key biota (soil microbes, insects, plants, small mammals), ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry, infectious disease dynamics, phenology, and population dynamics. The articles in this special issue describe the scientific rationale for the sampling designs of the TOS, including an overview of protocols, locations, and frequencies of measurements. The science designs are a culmination of design requirements scoped by NEON and the National Science Foundation, best available practices put forth by the scientific community, input from technical working groups, and consideration of logistical and financial constraints by NEON staff. Within each site, measurements have been collocated to the extent possible to optimize linkages among different sampling elements. Integrated analyses of terrestrial observations with sensor-based, imagery, and remote-sensing data collected by other NEON subsystems can facilitate scaling of measured parameters to larger spatial and temporal scales. NEON is designed to collect data for 30 years, and make these data freely available on a public data portal (data.neonscience.org). Samples and specimens will be archived and available to the scientific community upon request. The open access approach to the Observatory will provide users with the resources necessary to map, understand, and predict the effects of global change drivers on ecological processes at a continental scale.

The term includes changes in climate and climate variability, atmospheric composition, land use and land cover including deforestation and urbanisation. bio-geochemistry. globalisation of trade and transport, the spread of alien species, human health and technology. A subset of land use issues relates to the management of protective technologies in relation to residues in food and the environment and the emergence of resistance. Another is the question or changing biodiversity of both parasites and their associated natural enemies. and the effects on the host-parasite relationship and on parasite management. A framework for studying impacts of global change is proposed and illustrated with field data, and CLIMEX and simulation modelling of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus in Australia. Parasitology suffers from the perception that the key impacts of global change will be driven by changes at lower trophic levels. with parasitic interactions being treated as secondary effects. This is incorrect because the environment mediates host-parasite interactions as much as it affects parasites directly. Parasitologists need to strive for holistic solutions to the management of animal and human health, within a wider contest of overall management of those systems, if they are to make a meaningful contribution to global efforts aimed at coping with global change.

However, dramatic meadow degradation has been observed due to climate change and pika damage, but their impacts on soil-borne pathogens are still unclear. With approximately 40% of the world's population living in Tibetan Plateau and its downstream watersheds, this lack of knowledge should be of great concern. Here, we used Illumina amplicon sequencing to characterize the changes in potential human, domestic animal, plant, and zoonotic bacterial and fungal pathogens in nondegraded, desertified, and pika-burrowed meadows. The relative abundance of bacterial domestic animal pathogens and zoonotic pathogens were significantly increased by desertification. Pika burrowing significantly increased the relative abundance of bacterial human pathogens and zoonotic pathogens. The species richness and relative abundance of fungal pathogens was significantly increased by desertification and pika burrowing. Accordingly, fungal plant and animal pathogens categorized by FUNGuid significantly increased in desertified and pika-burrowed meadows. Soil chemical and plant properties explained 38% and 64% of the bacterial and fungal pathogen community variance, respectively. Therefore, our study indicates for the first time that both alpine meadow desertification and pika burrowing could potentially increase infectious disease risks in the alpine ecosystem, especially for fungal diseases.

Old problems on a new playing field: Helminth zoonoses transmitted among dogs, wildlife, and people in a changing northern climate	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY				Article								Although surveillance is limited, indigenous residents at latitudes ranging from 53 to 73 degrees N in Canada appear to have a higher occurrence of infection with some zoonotic parasites than the general population. Conversely, they are relatively naive to other zoonotic parasites that have previously been unable to establish at northern latitudes. For those parasites that circulate among dogs, wildlife, and people, potential risk factors in the North include limited availability of veterinary services, presence of free-roaming dog populations, and consumption of locally harvested fish and wildlife. These regions are also experiencing some of the greatest impacts of climate change in North America, including increased temperature, precipitation, and frequency and severity of extreme weather. We review the current taxonomy, genetic diversity, host and geographic distributions, epidemiology and risk factors for 3 genera of helminths (Diphyllobothrium spp., Echinococcus spp., and Toxocara sp.) in Canada's North in order to identify climate-sensitive aspects of their ecology. Free-living stages of parasitic zoonoses endemic in the Arctic (such as Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, the cervid strain of Echinococcus granulosus, and Arctic strains of Echinococcus multilocularis) will experience trade-offs between enhanced survival under wetter conditions and increased mortality under warmer conditions. Climate change might also lead to the introduction and establishment in the Arctic of parasitic zoonoses previously restricted to the sub-Arctic, such as Diphyllobothrium latum, Toxocara cants, and the prairie strain of E. multilocularis. Molecular techniques applied in broad geographic surveys are needed to address critical knowledge gaps in the geographic distribution, genetic diversity, and public health significance of zoonotic helminths already in the circumpolar North, and to determine the current barriers to range expansion of temperate-adapted parasites into the North. Dogs will continue to play important roles in the North, including that of a "bridging" host between sylvatic cycles and human communities. In a warming north, increased opportunities for business, agriculture, and tourism favor importation of dogs and their parasites into a newly suitable environment. Collaborations among veterinarians, public health personnel, and policy-makers are needed to enhance surveillance and mitigate for dog-transmitted parasitic zoonoses in a changing North.

Biological invaders are threats to human health: an overview	ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION				Article								Invasive alien species are one of the major agents of human-accelerated global change: they threaten biodiversity, alter ecosystem structure, functions and services, inflict large economic costs and cause serious problems to human health. The effects on human health are indeed a major problem and also cause substantial costs but, surprisingly, very few studies have analyzed this topic. The paper describes and analyses the hazards to human health associated with species introductions, and discusses major correlates and possible responses. Four categories were identified: invasive species (1) causing diseases or infections; (2) exposing humans to wounds from bites/stings, biotoxins, allergens or toxicants; (3) faciliting diseases, injuries or death; and (4) inflicting other negative effects on human livelihood. Invasive species affect human health via several ways, i.e. as alien pathogens and invaders that bring/facilitate parasites or produce toxins. Others cause denutrition/malnutrition or exert displaced or deferred impacts. Their negative impacts are expected to intensify in the near future due to the increased opportunities of invasions associated with climate change, the augmented pathways of introductions and the synergic effects of climate change. It is imperative to improve our understanding of the pathways of arrival of invasive species affecting human health, their biological patterns and the mechanisms of impact, because all this information is essential to develop more effective and stringent policies for preventing and mitigating the negative effects that these species cause.

J	Cumming, GS; Guegan, JF				Cumming, Graeme S.; Guegan, Jean-Francois			Food webs and disease: Is pathogen diversity limited by vector diversity?	ECOHEALTH				Article								Classical predator-prey and host-parasite systems have been extensively studied in a food web context. Less attention has been paid to communities that include pathogens and their vectors. We present a coarse-grained, pan-African analysis of the relationships between the abiotic environment (location, precipitation, temperature), the species richness and community composition of ixodid ticks, and the species richness and community composition of pathogens that ticks transmit to humans. We found strong correlations between the abiotic environment and tick species richness, and a weak but significant correlation between the abiotic environment and pathogen species richness. A substantial amount of variation in community composition of parasites and pathogens was not explained by the variables that we considered. A structural equation model that compensated for the indirect effects of climate on the pathogen community via tick community composition suggested that while the environment strongly regulates tick community composition and tick community composition strongly regulates pathogen community composition, abiotic influences on pathogen species richness and community composition are weak. Our results support the view that changes in the broader environment will influence tick-borne pathogens primarily via the influence of the environment on ticks. The interactions that regulate host-vector-pathogen dynamics are of particular relevance in understanding the relationships between environmental change and health concerns, such as the impact of climate change on the occurrence of vector-borne diseases.

Animal-Symbiodinium Symbioses: Foundations of Coral Reef Ecosystems	MECHANISTIC BENEFITS OF MICROBIAL SYMBIONTS	Advances in Environmental Microbiology			Article; Book Chapter								A variety of animal taxa have benefited from symbioses with photoautotrophic symbionts that provide fixed carbon in exchange for nutrients and highlight habitats. Corals are one such animal lineage, harboring dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. This genus has remarkably high genetic diversity that translates into morphological, cellular, physiological, and even host infectivity differences. Many corals acquire their symbionts as larvae or recruits upon settlement on the reef, likely from local populations of Symbiodinium present in the sediment. Onset of symbiosis is initiated by host-symbiont recognition and proceeds through a winnowing process where only suitable, healthy Symbiodinium are retained within a host-derived symbiosome membrane. High stress, as is predicted by future climate models, can lead to symbiosis dysfunction and loss of the symbiont from host tissues with negative consequences to the host. Some corals have the ability to exchange their symbiotic partners for those that may be more thermotolerant, but the extent to which coral-dinoflagellate symbioses can acclimatize and adapt to rapid climate change remains to be determined.

J	Wells, K; Flynn, R				Wells, Konstans; Flynn, Robin			Managing host-parasite interactions in humans and wildlife in times of global change	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH				Review								Global change in the Anthropocene has modified the environment of almost any species on earth, be it through climate change, habitat modifications, pollution, human intervention in the form of mass drug administration (MDA), or vaccination. This can have far-reaching consequences on all organisational levels of life, including eco-physiological stress at the cell and organism level, individual fitness and behaviour, population viability, species interactions and biodiversity. Host- parasite interactions often require highly adapted strategies by the parasite to survive and reproduce within the host environment and ensure efficient transmission among hosts. Yet, our understanding of the system-level outcomes of the intricate interplay of within host survival and among host parasite spread is in its infancy. We shed light on how global change affects host-parasite interactions at different organisational levels and address challenges and opportunities to work towards better-informed management of parasite control. We argue that global change affects host-parasite interactions in wildlife inhabiting natural environments rather differently than in humans and invasive species that benefit from anthropogenic environments as habitat and more deliberate rather than erratic exposure to therapeutic drugs and other control efforts.

Agroecology and the design of climate change-resilient farming systems	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT				Review								Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO2 and associated "greenhouse" gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 A degrees C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and invasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate- and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.

J	Thorn, JPR				Thorn, Jessica P. R.			Adaptation "from below" to changes in species distribution, habitat and climate in agro-ecosystems in the Terai Plains of Nepal	AMBIO				Article								Recent land-use and climatic shifts are expected to alter species distributions, the provisioning of ecosystem services, and livelihoods of biodiversity-dependent societies living in multifunctional landscapes. However, to date, few studies have integrated social and ecological evidence to understand how humans perceive change, and adapt agro-ecological practices at the landscape scale. Mixed method fieldwork compared observed changes in plant species distribution across a climatic gradient to farmers' perceptions in biodiversity and climate change in rice-cultivated farms. In contrast to the global context, farmers in the Terai Plains of Nepal are acutely aware of high levels of change observed in the last 10 years, and incrementally adapt as new invasive species emerge (93%), the incidence and severity of pest/diseases increase (66%), genetic diversity of indigenous varieties erodes (65%), forest habitats diminish (98%), irrigation water declines (60%), and wildlife ranges shift. Twenty-five changes in climate were reported by 97.5% of farmers to reduce provisioning services and food self-sufficiency, and increase exposure to waterborne pathogens, heat stress, and human or livestock mortality.

Considering that elevation gradients can be used as analogues for global warming, we carried out meta-analyses of 27 correlations between parasitoid richness and elevation and 140 correlations between parasitism rate and elevation in natural and semi-natural environments. We also explored various covariates that may explain the observed responses. Both parasitism rates and parasitoid species richness significantly decreased with increasing elevation. The decrease was greater for ectoparasitoids and parasitoids of ectophagous insects than for endoparasitoids and parasitoids of endophagous hosts, possibly because these latter are better protected from adverse and extreme climatic conditions occurring at higher elevations. Although our results suggest an increase of parasitism with increasing temperature, other factors regulating herbivorous insects have to be considered before concluding that climate warming will lead to a decrease in pest density.

Ecological risk screening of sturgeons introduced for aquaculture in Vietnam	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY				Article								Introduced non-native species are major threats to global biodiversity. In Vietnam, non-native sturgeons have been introduced and widely cultured, but their potential impacts on native aquatic ecosystems have not been screened. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate potential risks that sturgeons likely pose in Vietnam by using the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK) and interpret outcomes within a management context. Results showed that the Basic Risk Assessment (BRA) scores were 9.0-13.5 and the combined BRA and Climate Change Assessment (BRA+CCA) scores were 5.0-9.5. All five sturgeon species and two hybrid sturgeons cultured in Vietnam were classified as medium risk of invasiveness. Central concerns relating to introduced sturgeons included transmission of new infectious disease agents, and predation and competition for food with native species, especially threatened species. Controlling pathways of sturgeon importation through quarantine processes and preventing sturgeon from escaping into natural waterways are required if sturgeon aquaculture is to be sustainable, native species are to be protected, and biodiversity is to be conserved over the long term.

Infectious diseases are strong biotic forces that can precipitate population declines and lead to biodiversity loss. It has been shown in forest ecosystems worldwide that at least 10% of trees are vulnerable to extinction and pathogens are increasingly implicated. In Europe, the emerging ash dieback disease caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, commonly called Chalara fraxinea, is causing a severe mortality of common ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior); this is raising concerns for the persistence of this widespread tree, which is both a key component of forest ecosystems and economically important for timber production. Here, we show how the pathogen and climate change may interact to affect the future spatial distribution of the common ash. Using two presence-only models, seven General Circulation Models and four emission scenarios, we show that climate change, by affecting the host and the pathogen separately, may uncouple their spatial distribution to create a mismatch in species interaction and so a lowering of disease transmission. Consequently, as climate change expands the ranges of both species polewards it may alleviate the ash dieback crisis in southern and occidental regions at the same time.

Helminth community structure in two species of arctic-breeding waterfowl	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE				Article								Climate change is occurring rapidly at high latitudes, and subsequent changes in parasite communities may have implications for hosts including wildlife and humans. Waterfowl, in particular, harbor numerous parasites and may facilitate parasite movement across broad geographic areas due to migratory movements. However, little is known about helminth community structure of waterfowl at northern latitudes. We investigated the helminth communities of two avian herbivores that breed at high latitudes, Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans), and greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), to examine effects of species, geographic area, age, and sex on helminth species richness, aggregation, prevalence, and intensity. We collected 83 and 58 black brant and white-fronted geese, respectively, from Arctic and Subarctic Alaska July-August 2014. We identified 10 known helminth species (Amidostomum anseris, Amidostomum spatulatum, Drepanidotaenia lanceolata, Epomidiostomum crami, Heterakis dispar, Notocotylus attenuatus, Tetrameres striata, Trichostrongylus tenuis, Tschertkovilepis setigera, and Wardoides nyrocae) and 1 previously undescribed trematode. All geese sampled were infected with at least one helminth species. All helminth species identified were present in both age classes and species, providing evidence of transmission at high latitudes and suggesting broad host susceptibility. Also, all but one helminth species were present at both sites, suggesting conditions are suitable for transmission across a large latitudinal/environmental gradient. Our study provides important baseline information on avian parasites that can be used to evaluate the effects of a changing climate on host-parasite distributions.

This review summarises our current knowledge of the Mesomycetozoea, a poorly-studied group of fungal-like parasites that includes emerging virulent parasites capable of causing high mortality rates in fish and amphibian populations. This review considers the potential impact of emerging parasites in this class on global aquatic biodiversity. Several aspects of the biology of mesomycetozoean parasites are associated with the potential to drive hosts to extinction, including their high virulence under certain conditions, low host specificity, and a free-living infectious stage. In addition, mesomycetozoeans are currently being introduced into novel environments and hosts via the global freshwater wildlife trade. These parasites have been linked to dramatic population declines in at least one native fish throughout Europe, and there are indications that they are already impacting amphibian populations in America and Europe. The impact of mesomycetozoeans on freshwater biodiversity is likely to increase in response to stressors such as global climate change and habitat modification. Surveillance for mesomycetozoean parasites in the field and in specimens transported in the aquatic wildlife trade needs to be increased, and a tighter control of the aquatic wildlife trade is urgently needed.

J	Roulin, A				Roulin, Alexandre			Melanin-based colour polymorphism responding to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Review								Climate warming leads to a decrease in biodiversity. Organisms can deal with the new prevailing environmental conditions by one of two main routes, namely evolving new genetic adaptations or through phenotypic plasticity to modify behaviour and physiology. Melanin-based colouration has important functions in animals including a role in camouflage and thermoregulation, protection against UV-radiation and pathogens and, furthermore, genes involved in melanogenesis can pleiotropically regulate behaviour and physiology. In this article, I review the current evidence that differently coloured individuals are differentially sensitive to climate change. Predicting which of dark or pale colour variants (or morphs) will be more penalized by climate change will depend on the adaptive function of melanism in each species as well as how the degree of colouration covaries with behaviour and physiology. For instance, because climate change leads to a rise in temperature and UV-radiation and dark colouration plays a role in UV-protection, dark individuals may be less affected from global warming, if this phenomenon implies more solar radiation particularly in habitats of pale individuals. In contrast, as desertification increases, pale colouration may expand in those regions, whereas dark colourations may expand in regions where humidity is predicted to increase. Dark colouration may be also indirectly selected by climate warming because genes involved in the production of melanin pigments confer resistance to a number of stressful factors including those associated with climate warming. Furthermore, darker melanic individuals are commonly more aggressive than paler conspecifics, and hence they may better cope with competitive interactions due to invading species that expand their range in northern latitudes and at higher altitudes. To conclude, melanin may be a major component involved in adaptation to climate warming, and hence in animal populations melanin-based colouration is likely to change as an evolutionary or plastic response to climate warming.

Effects of climate change, such as higher average temperatures and earlier snowmelt, are already apparent, especially in alpine regions. However, community responses of functionally important arthropod taxa to changing climatic conditions are mostly unknown. 2. In this study, an earlier snowmelt was simulated at 15 plots along an elevational gradient in the German Alps. At each study site, soil emergence traps were established for sampling soil-hibernating arthropods on earlier and control snowmelt treatments during the growing season, The abundance and emergence phenology of the live most common arthropod orders (Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera) were analysed, as well as the species richness of Coleoptera. 3. There was increasing abundance and species richness of Coleoptera along the elevational gradient, indicating that at higher altitudes more individuals and species hibernate in the soil. Abundances of Diptera also increased with elevation. By contrast, abundances of Hemiptera declined with increasing elevation, while abundances of Araneae and Hymenoptera did not show significant elevational patterns. Arthropods at higher elevations emerged, on average, 5 weeks later than arthropods at lower elevations, because of a longer-lasting snow cover. The earlier snowmelt treatment resulted in higher abundances of Araneae and Hymenoptera compared with the control plots, indicating that the time of snowmelt influenced the abundance of predators, such as spiders or parasitic wasps, more than that of herbivores. 4. An earlier emergence of certain arthropod guilds and a change in relative abundance of guilds might desynchronise species interactions, leading to a possible loss of biodiversity	[Leingaertner, Annette; Krauss, Jochen; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany		Leingartner, A (corresponding author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.	annette.leingaertner@uni-wuerzburg.de								11	11											AUG	2014	39	4					412	418		10.1111/een.12112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12112				Entomology								2023-09-28	WOS:000340662000002

Including a genetic dimension into the IUCN Red List Criteria would greatly enhance conservation efforts, because the demographic parameters traditionally considered are poor predictors of the evolutionary resilience of natural populations to global change. Here we perform the first genomic assessment of genetic diversity, gene flow, and patterns of local adaptation in tropical plant species belonging to different IUCN Red List Categories. Employing RAD-sequencing we identified tens of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in an endangered narrow-endemic and a least concern widespread morning glory (Convolvulaceae) from Amazonian savannas, a highly threatened and under-protected tropical ecosystem. Our results reveal greater genetic diversity and less spatial genetic structure in the endangered species. Whereas terrain roughness affected gene flow in both species, forested and mining areas were found to hinder gene flow in the endangered plant. Finally we implemented environmental association tests and genome scans for selection, and identified a higher proportion of candidate adaptive loci in the widespread species. These mainly contained genes related to pathogen resistance and physiological adaptations to life in nutrient-limited environments. Our study emphasizes that IUCN Red List Criteria do not always prioritize species with low genetic diversity or whose genetic variation is being affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, and calls for the inclusion of genetic information into conservation assessments. More generally, our study exemplifies how landscape genomic tools can be employed to assess the status, threats and adaptive responses of imperiled biodiversity.

Diversity and epidemiology of plant rhabdoviruses	VIRUS RESEARCH				Review								Plant rhabdoviruses are recognized by their large bacilliform particles and for being able to replicate in both their plant hosts and arthropod vectors. This review highlights selected, better studied examples of plant rhabdoviruses, their genetic diversity, epidemiology and interactions with plant hosts and arthropod vectors: Alfalfa dwarf virus is classified as a cytorhabdovirus, but its multifunctional phosphoprotein is localized to the plant cell nucleus. Lettuce necrotic yellows virus subtypes may differentially interact with their aphid vectors leading to changes in virus population diversity. Interactions of rhabdoviruses that infect rice, maize and other grains are tightly associated with their specific leafhopper and planthopper vectors. Future outbreaks of vectorborne nucleorhabdoviruses may be predicted based on a world distribution map of the insect vectors.

Challenges for crop production and management from pathogen biodiversity and diseases under current and future climate scenarios - Case study with oilseed Brassicas	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH				Review								Climate change not only influences agricultural and horticultural crops but also the diseases that affect them. The different parameters associated with climate change, such as warmer temperatures, increased levels of CO2, decreased rainfall and increased rainfall variability, have been widely studied in terms of their influence on different aspects of pathogens and diseases across various crops. This includes pathogen life cycle, expression of host resistance, disease epidemiology and severity of disease epidemics, as well as pathogen inoculum production. Less well studied are the potential changes in pathogen biodiversity, such as development of races or pathotypes, in response to climate change. Future changes in both pathogen diversity and pathogen threats are built on the complex changes in crops and agricultural practices that can occur with or without climate change. Pathogens are successful opportunists that occupy any niche that is not adequately protected by crop protection strategies, including host resistance. Climate change will influence future changes in the distribution and the challenge of future pathogen threats and corresponding changes in pathogen diversity. Fungal and oomycete pathogens occurring on oilseed Brassicas provide strong indications of the abilities of pathogens to readily adapt to changes in climate, including changes in crops or cropping systems in response to future climate scenarios. Some existing climates, such as Mediterranean climates and regions, are historically highly variable in terms of environmental parameters, including the amount, timing and variability of temperature anti rainfall. These environments offer significant prospects for gaining a better insight and understanding of the processes involved with pathogen adaptation to future climate scenarios. While there have been attempts to date to define future expansion or contractions of some particular diseases in relation to future climate scenarios, including some diseases occurring on oilseed Brassicas, defining future distribution ranges of the most important pathogens, their races, and consequent disease challenges in relation to future climate changes remains an area of high priority. This information is critical for monitoring such changes over time and also for designing pre-emptive management strategies against pathogen threats for crops under future climate scenarios. Surprisingly, relatively little has been defined in terms of traits such as increased frequency of drought, higher temperatures, unpredictable and erratic wetting and drying cycles, salinity and inundation events in terms of the genes that determine differences in tolerance to such traits. Oilseed Brassicas include a range of different species making them an ideal prospect for use as a 'model' plant grouping for investigating and modelling impacts of biotic and abiotic stresses and their interactions under future climate scenarios. As a first step, the anticipated shifts in biotic and abiotic stress thresholds that occur across current environments for established and new Brassica crop species as a result of climate change could be defined. This includes how predicted future abiotic stresses could not only pre-dispose some species to more severe disease infections but also how they alter both pathogen diversity and expression of host resistances to diseases. Subsequently, the potential impacts of changing Brassica crop species on other components of cropping systems across different countries representing different current and future climate scenarios cold be defined. Using oilseed Brassicas as model species will not only define the potential hazards involved in simply shifting crop species initially to overcome abiotic limitations imposed by climate change, but will actually define the basis for capturing the benefits and opportunities these alternative Brassica species offer as a means of coping with climate change. In this way, oilseed Brassicas could be utilized to define pre-emptive management strategies, such as by breeding for better and/more appropriate types and levels of host resistance to pathogens and deploying host resistances in better and more controlled ways to maximize the longevity of such host resistance in the face of changing pathogen pathotypes. This review will utilize the outcomes of studies in relation to pathogens, particularly pathogen biodiversity, and diseases of oilseed Brassicas over past decades as a basis for outlining the challenges, opportunities and priorities for improving on current management successes such that crop yields can be maintained in the face of expected pathogen threats likely to occur under future climate scenarios.

Here, samples from brown hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea) from Namibia (BHNA) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) from Namibia (SHNA) and Tanzania (SHTZ) were screened for vector-borne pathogens to assess the frequency and genetic diversity of pathogens and the effect of ecological conditions and host taxonomy on this diversity. Methods Tissue samples from BHNA (n = 17), SHNA (n = 19) and SHTZ (n = 25) were analysed by PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., piroplasms, specifically Babesia lengau-like piroplasms, Hepatozoidae and filarioids. After sequencing, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum/platys-like and Anaplasma bovis-like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ. This is the first report of R. raoultii from sub-Saharan Africa. Babesia lengau-like piroplasms were found in 70.6% of BHNA, 88.9% of SHNA and 32.0% of SHTZ, showing higher sequence diversity than B. lengau from South African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). In one SHTZ, a Babesia vogeli-like sequence was identified. Hepatozoon felis-like parasites were identified in 64.7% of BHNA, 36.8% of SHNA and 44.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis placed the sequences outside the major H. felis cluster originating from wild and domestic felids. Filarioids were detected in 47.1% of BHNA, 47.4% of SHNA and 36.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity and suggested the presence of several undescribed species. Co-infections were frequently detected in SHNA and BHNA (BHNA median 3 pathogens, range 1-4; SHNA median 3 pathogens, range 2-4) and significantly rarer in SHTZ (median 1, range 0-4, 9 individuals uninfected). Conclusions The frequencies of all pathogens groups were high, and except for Rickettsia, multiple species and genotypes were identified for each pathogen group. Ecological conditions explained pathogen identity and diversity better than host taxonomy. Graphic	[Kruecken, Juergen; Ramunke, Sabrina; Costa, M.

Some invasive snail species may trigger disease emergence by acting as intermediate hosts. The geographic distribution of Schistosoma mansoni depends on the presence of susceptible species of Biomphalaria freshwater snails that support the parasite's transformation into infective stages. Biomphalaria spp. have shown strong local and global dispersal capacities that may increase due to the global warming phenomenon and increases in the development of agricultural and water projects. Should intermediate hosts become established in new areas then this will create potential transmission foci. Examples of snail invasions that have had an impact on schistosomiasis transmission include the introduction of Biomphalaria tenagophila to Congo and B. glabrata to Egypt. The current spread of B. straminea in China is causing concern and needs to be monitored closely. An understanding of the mode of invasion and distribution of these snails as well as their experimental susceptibility to S. mansoni will predict the potential spread of schistosomiasis. Here we review the invasion patterns of Biomphalaria snails and factors that control their distribution and the impact that invasion may have on intestinal schistosomiasis transmission. In addition, we propose some possible surveillance responses for optimum control strategies and interventions. Whenever possible, swift action should be taken to contain any new occurrence of these intermediate snail hosts.

Here, we address a plant pathogen that poses a serious threat to life on natural oases, where climate change is already taking a toll and severely impacting human subsistence. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis is a pathogen that causes dieback disease on date palms, a tree that provides several critical ecosystem services in natural oases; and consequently, of major importance in this vulnerable habitat. Here, we assess the current state of global pathogen spread, we annotate the genome of a sequenced pathogen strain isolated from the native range and we analyse its in silico secretome. The palm dieback pathogen secretes a large arsenal of effector candidates including a variety of toxins, a distinguished profile of secreted in xylem proteins (SIX) as well as an expanded protein family with an N-terminal conserved motif [SG]PC[KR]P that could be involved in interactions with host membranes. Using agrobiodiversity as a strategy to decrease pathogen infectivity, while providing short term resilient solutions, seems to be widely overcome by the pathogen. Hence, the urgent need for future mechanistic research on the palm dieback disease and a better understanding of pathogen genetic diversity.

Selecting for useful properties of plants and fungi - Novel approaches, opportunities, and challenges	PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET				Review								Societal Impact Statement For millennia, humans have used plants and fungi, as foods, fuels, fibers, and medicines; and have developed techniques for improving their usefulness to our species, mostly through selection of desirable traits. With human populations forecast to rise, the availability of arable land likely to fall amid climate change and increasing urbanization, and modern communications technologies accelerating the dispersal of pathogens, further improvement is urgently needed. However, ensuring long-term resilience involves conservation of existing genetic diversity in addition to selection. New technologies, particularly those based on molecular biology, are increasingly driving conservation and improvement strategies. SummaryHumans use plants and fungi for a wide range of purposes and, over millennia, have improved wild species by selecting for and combining genetic variation. Improvements in DNA sequencing technologies have enhanced our capacity to identify and manipulate genetic diversity, increasing the range of variation that can be utilized, and accelerating the breeding cycle to reduce the time taken to develop and put new varieties to use. Most recently, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has greatly increased our capacity to directly introduce novel genetic variants without unwanted associated material. Moreover, increased knowledge of metabolic pathways resulting from genomic analysis can be used to design new varieties with desired properties with increased precision. Selecting for, or engineering, desirable variants has increased the usefulness of plants and fungi to humans, but at the cost of reducing their genetic diversity, decreasing their resilience and reducing the stock of variation available for future use. Conservation of genetic biodiversity is thus an essential counterpart of crop improvement and is essential to ensure that crop species retain resilience to emerging threats. Conservation efforts are focused on orphan crops, wild relatives of crop species, and landraces; in and exsitu efforts are complementary. Informatic approaches can inform use of these materials in breeding programmes even in the absence of genomic information. The application of some of these approaches may be restricted by ethical, legal, or organizational obstacles. If these can be overcome, there is great potential to unlock previously untapped reservoirs of biodiversity for human benefit.

Transmission of vector borne pathogens are particularly sensitive to these changes due to the complexity of their cycle, where the transmission of a microparasite depends on the interaction between its vector, usually a macroparasite, and its reservoir host, in many cases represented by a wildlife vertebrate. The scope of this paper focuses on the effect of some major, fast-occurring anthropogenic changes on the vectorial capacity for tick and mosquito borne pathogens. Specifically, we review and present the latest advances regarding two emerging vector-borne viruses in Europe: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV). In both cases, variation in vector to host ratio is critical in determining the intensity of pathogen transmission and consequently infection hazard for humans. Forecasting vector-borne disease hazard under the global change scenarios is particularly challenging, requiring long term studies based on a multidisciplinary approach in a One-Health framework.

Effects of parasite and historic driven selection on the diversity and structure of a MHC-II gene in a small mammal species (Peromyscus leucopus) undergoing range expansion	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY				Article								Genetic diversity may decrease from the centre to the margin of a species distribution range due to neutral stochastic processes. Selection may also alter genetic diversity in non-neutral markers, such as genes associated with the immune system. Both neutral processes and selection on the immune system are thus expected to affect the spatial distribution of such markers, but the relative strength of each has been scarcely studied. Here, we compared the diversity of a neutral marker (mitochondrial cytochrome b) and a selected marker (DRB gene from the MHC-II), in eastern-North American populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), a species known for its role of main reservoir of the Lyme disease. We observed distinct phylogeographic patterns with these two markers, which may be the result of selection pressure acting upon the DRB gene. As predicted by the central marginal hypothesis, we observed a loss of neutral genetic diversity toward the margin of the species distribution. A decrease in diversity was also observed for the DRB gene, likely due to genetic drift and positive selection operated by helminth parasites. Such a loss in genetic diversity at the range margin may slow down the ongoing expansion of P. leucopus, by counterbalancing the effect of global warming on the mouse survival at higher latitude.

Peter			GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES OF VERVET MONKEYS (CHLOROCEBUS PYGERYTHRUS) IN A HIGH LATITUDE, SEMI-ARID REGION OF SOUTH AFRICA	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY				Article								Given a changing climate and large-scale human migration, understanding infectious diseases in wildlife and the factors that drive the spread of these diseases is becoming increasingly important. Owing to the close phylogenetic relationship between nonhuman primates and humans, primate parasites are of particular interest due to the potential for zoonotic disease transmission and for the study of social transmission within gregarious social groups. There is a wide range of social and environmental factors that influence the prevalence and transmission of pathogens, and identifying these, and their effects, is crucial to understanding the population-level consequences of climate change for animals that live in obligate social groups. Here we investigated gastrointestinal parasite species richness and used fecal egg counts to estimate worm intensities in 3 vervet monkey troops (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) in a high latitude, semi-arid region of South Africa. This region is characterized by unpredictable rainfall and temperature extremes in summer and winter. We identified the gastrointestinal parasites in the population and explored potential demographic predictors, namely sex and troop membership, of parasite species richness and estimated intensity. Additionally, we assessed whether there was short-term intra-individual, inter-sample consistency in egg counts. Six species of gastrointestinal helminths were identified from 3 study troops, with egg counts ranging from 0 eggs/g to 1,100 eggs/g. Neither age nor sex predicted species richness or estimated intensity. This population had the highest prevalence of parasites with an insect vector compared with all other vervet populations studied, and distinctively high prevalences of Trichostrongylus sp. (71%) and Ternidens sp. (27%). Additionally, we found intra-individual egg count consistency in the short term (mean: 32 days).	[Blersch, Rosemary; Young, Christopher; Barrett, Louise; Henzi, S.

Alpine grassland is an important and characteristic ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but ca. 30 % has been severely degraded by the combined effects of climate change, human activity, overgrazing and rodent damage. One potential method to restore grassland diversity involves using hemiparasitic plants to modify the competitive relationships among neighboring species. A possible candidate is Pedicularis kansuensis, a hemiparasitic plant found in grasslands throughout the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but more information on its host associations and its effects on surrounding vegetation is required to assess its suitability. Thus, we examined host associations of P. kansuensis by direct root excavation at a selected site on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and found that haustoria formation is non-randomly distributed among host species, with preferential bias for members of Poaceae, Rosaceae and Fabaceae. We also found that aboveground biomass of grasses and legumes was higher in quadrats from which the parasite had been removed than in intact controls, while the biomass of sedges and forbs was unaffected by parasite removal. However, removal significantly decreased plant species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity. These results suggest that P. kansuensis modifies the competitive balance in grassland communities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, allowing for colonization by subordinate species and thereby enhancing species diversity and contributing to restoration of these degraded grasslands.

This has focussed on important mosquito-borne diseases that are transmitted by the vectors from infected to uninfected humans. However, this debate has mostly ignored the biological diversity of vectors and vector-borne diseases. Here, we review how climate and climate change may impact those most divergent of arthropod disease vector groups: multivoltine insects and hard-bodied (ixodid) ticks. We contrast features of the life cycles and behaviour of these arthropods, and how weather, climate, and climate change may have very different impacts on the spatiotemporal occurrence and abundance of vectors, and the pathogens they transmit.

Kuntze is a fungus which induces strip-cankers on beech, commonly referred to as charcoal canker. The symptoms of infection are visible on the host tree's bark as elongated, blackish bark lesions on the trunk and branches. Recent years have shown that, due to climate change causing local epidemics, the species is increasing its economic impact in Mediterranean regions. Until recently, B. nummularia was considered rare and uncommon in central Europe. However, in the last few years it has been noticed more often, mostly in coniferous trees, which are out of B. nummularia's host range. A similar situation has been observed with the closely related species Biscogniauxia mediterranea (De Not.) Kuntze, which prior to 2017 had not been observed in central Europe at all. This study shows the genetic diversity of mid-European strains of Biscogniauxia spp. (based on the ITS, TEF1, TUB2 and ACT regions) and, as the first in Europe, presents a molecular investigation of this species isolated from coniferous trees.

However, compared with charismatic animals and plants, the distribution patterns and conservation needs of fungi have been little explored. Here, we examined endemicity patterns, global change vulnerability and conservation priority areas for functional groups of soil fungi based on six global surveys using a high-resolution, long-read metabarcoding approach. We found that the endemicity of all fungi and most functional groups peaks in tropical habitats, including Amazonia, Yucatan, West-Central Africa, Sri Lanka, and New Caledonia, with a negligible island effect compared with plants and animals. We also found that fungi are predominantly vulnerable to drought, heat and land-cover change, particularly in dry tropical regions with high human population density. Fungal conservation areas of highest priority include herbaceous wetlands, tropical forests, and woodlands. We stress that more attention should be focused on the conservation of fungi, especially root symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi in tropical regions as well as unicellular early-diverging groups and macrofungi in general. Given the low overlap between the endemicity of fungi and macroorganisms, but high conservation needs in both groups, detailed analyses on distribution and conservation requirements are warranted for other microorganisms and soil organisms.

Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrates and have been subject to increasing conservation attention over the past decade. A particular concern is the pandemic emergence of the parasitic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which has been identified as the cause of extremely rapid large-scale declines and species extinctions. Experimental and observational studies have demonstrated that the host-pathogen system is strongly influenced by climatic parameters and thereby potentially affected by climate change. Herein we project a species distribution model of the pathogen onto future climatic scenarios generated by the IPCC to examine their potential implications on the pandemic. Results suggest that predicted anthropogenic climate change may reduce the geographic range of B. dendrobatidis and its potential influence on amphibian biodiversity.

A framework for leishmaniasis in South and Meso-America	PLOS ONE				Article								The enormous global burden of vector-borne diseases disproportionately affects poor people in tropical, developing countries. Changes in vector-borne disease impacts are often linked to human modification of ecosystems as well as climate change. For tropical ecosystems, the health impacts of future environmental and developmental policy depend on how vector-borne disease risks trade off against other ecosystem services across heterogeneous landscapes. By linking future socio-economic and climate change pathways to dynamic land use models, this study is amongst the first to analyse and project impacts of both land use and climate change on continental-scale patterns in vector-borne diseases. Models were developed for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas D ecologically complex sand fly borne infections linked to tropical forests and diverse wild and domestic mammal hosts. Both diseases were hypothesised to increase with available interface habitat between forest and agricultural or domestic habitats and with mammal biodiversity. However, landscape edge metrics were not important as predictors of leishmaniasis. Models including mammal richness were similar in accuracy and predicted disease extent to models containing only climate and land use predictors. Overall, climatic factors explained 80% and land use factors only 20% of the variance in past disease patterns. Both diseases, but especially cutaneous leishmaniasis, were associated with low seasonality in temperature and precipitation. Since such seasonality increases under future climate change, particularly under strong climate forcing, both diseases were predicted to contract in geographical extent to 2050, with cutaneous leishmaniasis contracting by between 35% and 50%. Whilst visceral leishmaniasis contracted slightly more under strong than weak management for carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services, future cutaneous leishmaniasis extent was relatively insensitive to future alternative socio-economic pathways. Models parameterised at narrower geographical scales may be more sensitive to land use pattern and project more substantial changes in disease extent under future alternative socio-economic pathways.

EMERGING PESTS AND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES IN EUROPE	Ecology and Control of Vector-Borne Diseases			Article; Book Chapter								Emerging infectious diseases have had, and likely will have, a great impact on human and animal populations, and on biodiversity. Avian malaria is one such disease, which reached epidemic levels soon after its introduction in Hawaii and contributed to a massive decrease of avian biodiversity on the island group. Avian malaria is also a common infection amongst endemic and migratory birds in Europe, but appears to cause little harm among the native birds. However, frequent deaths of non-indigenous birds due to avian malaria are being reported. In this chapter, we consider whether avian malaria can reach epidemic proportions in Europe as an emerging infectious disease and as a result of climate change. In an ecological field study, we investigated the occurrence of avian malaria in Rotterdam zoo in the Netherlands during the summer of 2003. In a longitudinal approach mosquito dynamics were studied and a cross-sectional study was undertaken to estimate parasite prevalence in exotic birds kept in the zoo. Adult mosquitoes were caught throughout the study period and were examined for parasite infections. Of the 575 adult mosquitoes caught in traps, 61 percent was Culex pipiens pipiens. Six mosquitoes of this species were infected with malaria. Nine birds, belonging to eight different species, were infected with malaria, out of 81 birds that were examined. Twelve other birds died later that summer and were diagnosed with avian malaria, most of them being black-footed penguins. The peak in mortality occurred in the third week of August, two weeks after the peak in larval mosquito densities. It appeared that there is annual seasonal malaria transmission within Rotterdam zoo. We suggest that these infections result from a reservoir of parasites living within less susceptible exotic birds that are kept in the zoo and in endemic birds living within or near the zoo. These field data support our view that an outbreak of avian malaria among the endemic bird population of Europe is unlikely to happen under the current circumstances. Avian malaria is a common parasitic infection in the endemic and migratory bird populations, and after a long history of co-evolution, the parasites are causing what appears to be little harm. However, a change of climate or parasite mutational events could alter the equilibrium between parasite and host, potentially resulting in an epidemic. Frequent screening of the endemic and migratory bird populations should therefore be employed to prevent an outbreak such as happened in Hawaii.

B	Abrol, DP	Abrol, DP			Abrol, Dharam P.	Abrol, DP		Decline in Pollinators	POLLINATION BIOLOGY: BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION				Article; Book Chapter								Pollinators are a key component of global biodiversity, providing vital ecosystem services to crops and wild plants. There is clear evidence of recent declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel declines in the plants that rely upon them. Birds, bees, bats and other species that pollinate plants life are declining at alarming rate which has threatened the existence of plant life and this downward trend could damage dozens of commercially important crops. A decline in pollinator populations is one form of global change that actually has credible potential to alter the shape and structure of terrestrial ecosystems. The decline in pollinator population and diversity presents a serious threat to agricultural production and conservation and maintenance of biodiversity in many parts of the world. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop production, food security and human welfare. This paper discusses the world scenario on the causes of pollinator decline, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, climate change and the interactions between them and future strategies to overcome the impending crisis.

Mechanisms driving change: altered species interactions and ecosystem function through global warming	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				Review								P>1. We review the mechanisms behind ecosystem functions, the processes that facilitate energy transfer along food webs, and the major processes that allow the cycling of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, and use case studies to show how these have already been, and will continue to be, altered by global warming. 2. Increased temperatures will affect the interactions between heterotrophs and autotrophs (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal), and between heterotrophs (e.g. predators-prey, parasites/pathogens-hosts), with generally negative ramifications for important ecosystem services (functions that provide direct benefit to human society such as pollination) and potential for heightened species co-extinction rates. 3. Mitigation of likely impacts of warming will require, in particular, the maintenance of species diversity as insurance for the provision of basic ecosystem services. Key to this will be long-term monitoring and focused research that seek to maintain ecosystem resilience in the face of global warming. 4. We provide guidelines for pursuing research that quantifies the nexus between ecosystem function and global warming. These include documentation of key functional species groups within systems, and understanding the principal outcomes arising from direct and indirect effects of a rapidly warming environment. Localized and targeted research and monitoring, complemented with laboratory work, will determine outcomes for resilience and guide adaptive conservation responses and long-term planning.

A statement of the World Allergy Organization	WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL				Review								The prevalence of allergic airway diseases such as asthma and rhinitis has increased dramatically to epidemic proportions worldwide. Besides air pollution from industry derived emissions and motor vehicles, the rising trend can only be explained by gross changes in the environments where we live. The world economy has been transformed over the last 25 years with developing countries being at the core of these changes. Around the planet, in both developed and developing countries, environments are undergoing profound changes. Many of these changes are considered to have negative effects on respiratory health and to enhance the frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general population. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere have already warmed the planet substantially, causing more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods - all of which can put the respiratory health of the public at risk. These changes in climate and air quality have a measurable impact not only on the morbidity but also the mortality of patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. The massive increase in emissions of air pollutants due to economic and industrial growth in the last century has made air quality an environmental problem of the first order in a large number of regions of the world. A body of evidence suggests that major changes to our world are occurring and involve the atmosphere and its associated climate. These changes, including global warming induced by human activity, have an impact on the biosphere, biodiversity, and the human environment. Mitigating this huge health impact and reversing the effects of these changes are major challenges. This statement of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) raises the importance of this health hazard and highlights the facts on climate-related health impacts, including: deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves and extreme meteorological events; increased frequency of acute cardio-respiratory events due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone; changes in the frequency of respiratory diseases due to trans-boundary particle pollution; altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens (pollens, molds, and mites); and some infectious disease vectors. According to this report, these impacts will not only affect those with current asthma but also increase the incidence and prevalence of allergic respiratory conditions and of asthma. The effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still not well defined, and more studies addressing this topic are needed. Global warming is expected to affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand, and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to air pollution, respiratory infections, and/or cold air inhalation, and other conditions on the other hand.

J	Wood, CL; Vanhove, MPM				Wood, Chelsea L.; Vanhove, Maarten P. M.			Is the world wormier than it used to be? We'll never know without natural history collections	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				Article								Many disease ecologists and conservation biologists believe that the world is wormier than it used to be-that is, that parasites are increasing in abundance through time. This argument is intuitively appealing. Ecologists typically see parasitic infections, through their association with disease, as a negative endpoint, and are accustomed to attributing negative outcomes to human interference in the environment, so it slots neatly into our worldview that habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and climate change should have the collateral consequence of causing outbreaks of parasites. But surprisingly, the hypothesis that parasites are increasing in abundance through time remains entirely untested for the vast majority of wildlife parasite species. Historical data on parasites are nearly impossible to find, which leaves no baseline against which to compare contemporary parasite burdens. If we want to know whether the world is wormier than it used to be, there is only one major research avenue that will lead to an answer: parasitological examination of specimens preserved in natural history collections. Recent advances demonstrate that, for many specimen types, it is possible to extract reliable data on parasite presence and abundance. There are millions of suitable specimens that exist in collections around the world. When paired with contemporaneous environmental data, these parasitological data could even point to potential drivers of change in parasite abundance, including climate, pollution or host density change. We explain how to use preserved specimens to address pressing questions in parasite ecology, give a few key examples of how collections-based parasite ecology can resolve these questions, identify some pitfalls and workarounds, and suggest promising areas for research. Natural history specimens are 'parasite time capsules' that give ecologists the opportunity to test whether infectious disease is on the rise and to identify what forces might be driving these changes over time. This approach will facilitate major advances in a new sub-discipline: the historical ecology of parasitism.

Factors affecting virus dynamics and microbial host-virus interactions in marine environments	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY				Review								Marine microorganisms constitute the largest percentage of living biomass and serve as the major driving force behind nutrient and energy cycles. While viruses only comprise a small percentage of this biomass (i.e., 5%), they dominate in numerical abundance and genetic diversity. Through host infection and mortality, viruses affect microbial population dynamics, community composition, genetic evolution, and biogeochemical cycling. However, the field of marine viral ecology is currently limited by a lack of data regarding how different environmental factors regulate virus dynamics and host-virus interactions. The goal of the present minireview was to contribute to the evolution of marine viral ecology, through the assimilation of available data regarding the manner and degree to which environmental factors affect viral decay and infectivity as well as influence latent period and production. Considering the ecological importance of viruses in the marine ecosystem and the increasing pressure from anthropogenic activity and global climate change on marine systems, a synthesis of existing information provides a timely framework for future research initiatives in viral ecology.

Hemoparasites in a wild primate: Infection patterns suggest interaction of Plasmodium and Babesia in a lemur species	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE				Article								Hemoparasites can cause serious morbidity in humans and animals and often involve wildlife reservoirs. Understanding patterns of hemoparasite infections in natural populations can therefore inform about emerging disease risks, especially in the light of climate change and human disruption of natural ecosystems. We investigated the effects of host age, sex, host group size and season on infection patterns of Plasmodium sp., Babesia sp. and filarial nematodes in a population of wild Malagasy primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), as well as the effects of these infections on hematological variables. We tested 45 blood samples from 36 individuals and identified two species of Plasmodium, one species of Babesia and two species of filarial nematodes. Plasmodium spp. and Babesia sp. infections showed opposite patterns of age-dependency, with babesiosis being prevalent among young animals, while older animals were infected with Plasmodium sp. In addition, Babesia sp. infection was a statistically significant negative predictor of Plasmodium sp. infection. These results suggest that Plasmodium and Babesia parasites may interact within the host, either through cross-immunity or via resource competition, so that Plasmodium infections can only establish after babesiosis has resolved. We found no effects of host sex, host group size and season on hemoparasite infections. Infections showed high prevalences and did not influence hematological variables. This preliminary evidence supports the impression that the hosts and parasites considered in this study appear to be well-adapted to each other, resulting in persistent infections with low pathogenic and probably low zoonotic potential. Our results illustrate the crucial role of biodiversity in host-parasite relationships, specifically how within-host pathogen diversity may regulate the abundance of parasites. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Admiralty Bay Benthos Diversity-A census of a complex polar ecosystem	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY				Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Census of Antarctic Marine Life - Diversity and Change in Southern Ocean Ecosystems	MAY, 2009	Genoa, ITALY					A thorough census of Admiralty Bay benthic biodiversity was completed through the synthesis of data, acquired from more than 30 years of observations. Most of the available records arise from successive Polish and Brazilian Antarctic expeditions organized since 1977 and 1982, respectively, but also include new data from joint collecting efforts during the International Polar Year (2007-2009). Geological and hydrological characteristics of Admiralty Bay and a comprehensive species checklist with detailed data on the distribution and nature of the benthic communities are provided. Approximately 1300 species of benthic organisms (excluding bacteria, fungi and parasites) were recorded from the bay's entire depth range (0-500 m). Generalized classifications and the descriptions of soft-bottom and hard-bottom invertebrate communities are presented. A time-series analysis showed seasonal and interannual changes in the shallow benthic communities, likely to be related to ice formation and ice melt within the bay. As one of the best studied regions in the maritime Antarctic Admiralty Bay represents a legacy site, where continued, systematically integrated data sampling can evaluate the effects of climate change on marine life. Both high species richness and high assemblage diversity of the Admiralty Bay shelf benthic community have been documented against the background of habitat heterogeneity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Disease control tools to secure animal and public health in a densely populated world	LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH				Review								Animal health is a prerequisite for global health, economic development, food security, food quality, and poverty reduction, while mitigating against climate change and biodiversity loss. We did a qualitative review of 53 infectious diseases in terrestrial animals with data from DISCONTOOLS, a specialist database and prioritisation model focusing on research gaps for improving infectious disease control in animals. Many diseases do not have any appropriate control tools, but the prioritisation model suggests that we should focus international efforts on Nipah virus infection, African swine fever, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, peste des petits ruminants, sheeppox and goatpox, avian influenza, Rift Valley fever, foot and mouth disease, and bovine tuberculosis, for the greatest impact on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Easy to use and accurate diagnostics are available for many animal diseases. However, there is an urgent need for the development of stable and durable diagnostics that can differentiate infected animals from vaccinated animals, to exploit rapid technological advances, and to make diagnostics widely available and affordable. Veterinary vaccines are important for dealing with endemic, new, and emerging diseases. However, fundamental research is needed to improve the convenience of use and duration of immunity, and to establish performant marker vaccines. The largest gap in animal pharmaceuticals is the threat of pathogens developing resistance to available drugs, in particular for bacterial and parasitic (protozoal, helminth, and arthropod) pathogens. We propose and discuss five research priorities for animal health that will help to deliver a sustainable and healthy planet: vaccinology, antimicrobial resistance, climate mitigation and adaptation, digital health, and epidemic preparedness.

Climate change mitigation through adaptation: the effectiveness of forest diversification by novel tree planting regimes	ECOSPHERE				Article								Climate change is projected to have negative implications for forest ecosystems and their dependent communities and industries. Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world's northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015-2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests.

Impacts of an Introduced Forest Pathogen on the Risk of Lyme Disease in California	VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES				Article								Global changes such as deforestation, climate change, and invasive species have the potential to greatly alter zoonotic disease systems through impacts on biodiversity. This study examined the impact of the invasive pathogen that causes sudden oak death (SOD) on the ecology of Lyme disease in California. The Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, is maintained in the far western United States by a suite of animal reservoirs including the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and is transmitted by the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus). Other vertebrates, such as the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), are important tick hosts but are not reservoirs of the pathogen. Previous work found that higher levels of SOD are correlated with greater abundance of P. maniculatus and S. occidentalis and lower N. fuscipes abundance. Here we model the contribution of these tick hosts to Lyme disease risk and also evaluate the potential impact of SOD on infection prevalence of the tick vector. By empirically parameterizing a static model with field and laboratory data on tick hosts, we predict that SOD reduces an important index of disease risk, nymphal infection prevalence, leading to a reduction in Lyme disease risk in certain coastal woodlands. Direct observational analysis of the impact of SOD on nymphal infection prevalence supports these model results. This study underscores the important direct and indirect impacts of invasive plant pathogens on biodiversity, the transmission cycles of zoonotic diseases, and ultimately human health.

J	Poulin, R; Presswell, B; Jorge, F				Poulin, Robert; Presswell, Bronwen; Jorge, Fatima			The state of fish parasite discovery and taxonomy: a critical assessment and a look forward	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				Review								Efforts to find and characterise new parasite species in fish hosts are crucial not just to complete our inventory of Earth's biodiversity, but also to monitor and mitigate disease threats in fisheries and aquaculture in the face of global climate change. Here, we review recent quantitative assessments of research efforts into fish parasite discovery and taxonomy. We address broad questions including: Are efforts aimed at finding new parasite species targeted at geographical hotspots of fish biodiversity, where there should be more parasite species to be found? Is the application of molecular tools to study parasite genetic diversity deployed strategically across regions of the world, or focused disproportionately on certain areas? How well coordinated is the search for new parasite species of fish among workers specialising on different higher helminth taxa? Are parasite discovery efforts in any geographical area consistent over time, or subject to idiosyncrasies due to the waxing and waning of highly prolific research careers? Is the quality of taxonomic descriptions of new species improving over time, with the incorporation of new tools to characterise species? Are taxonomic descriptions moving away from a focus on the adult stage only toward attempts to characterise the full life cycle of newly-discovered helminth species? By using empirical evidence to answer these questions, we assess the current state of research into fish parasite discovery and taxonomy. We also explore the far-reaching implications of recent research on parasite microbiomes for parasite taxonomy. We end with recommendations aimed at maximising the knowledge gained per fish sacrificed, and per dollar and time invested into research on fish parasite biodiversity.

J	Lazaro-Lobo, A; Ruiz-Benito, P; Castro-Diez, P				Lazaro-Lobo, Adrian; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Castro-Diez, Pilar			National forest inventories as a tool to assess the status and trends of exotic species	ECOSISTEMAS				Review								Biological invasions are an important component of global change, which is threatening the planet's biodiversity and ecosystem services . To manage and mitigate the impacts of global change, it is important to have monitoring tools that allow assessing the impacts of exotic species at several scales in a systematic, periodic, rapid, and effective way. National forest inventories (NFIs) are an emerging tool for monitoring forest structure and dynamics at large spatial scales. NFIs have been used globally to assess biological diversity, species distributions, and ecosystem services provision in forests. Moreover, NFIs have the potential to study various theoretical and applied aspects of biological invasions. We conducted a literature review to evaluate what studies about exotic species have been published using information from NFIs. We found 96 studies that used NFIs to assess the status or dynamics of exotic species in the United States (74), Europe (20), Canada (1) and Australia (1). Over half of the studies were conducted on the distribution, expansion risk, demography, or impacts of exotic plants (64). The remaining studies used NFIs to investigate expansion risk or impacts caused by other types of exotic species, including insects (20), fungal or protist pathogens (6), insects and pathogens (4), deer (1) and the giant African land snail (1) Lastly, we discuss the opportunities and limitations of NFIs, highlighting their potential to expand theoretical and applied studies on biological invasions.

EMERGING VIRAL INFECTIONS IN PAKISTAN: ISSUES, CONCERNS, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS	HEALTH SECURITY				Article								Emerging infectious diseases pose a serious threat to public health security; this is especially true in the underdeveloped world because of limited resources to combat them. These emerging pathogens are characterized by a novel mode of pathogenesis and, in some cases, a broad host range. Over the past few decades, Pakistan has suffered a great deal from infectious diseases such as dengue, Crimean-Congo fever, hepatitis, measles, and polio. Changing climate conditions, environmental degradation, global warming, loss of biodiversity, and other ecological determinants have a direct effect on these diseases and result in the emergence and reemergence of infectious entities. The causes of such disease outbreaks are complex and often not well understood. Dealing with an outbreak requires an integrated and coordinated approach, with decision making by various state departments. Stringent biosecurity and biosafety protocols can help to reduce the chances of infection dissemination. In order to mitigate the risks associated with emerging pathogens, there is a greater need to understand the interactions of pathogen-host-environment, to monitor molecular evolution and genomic surveillance, and to facilitate the gearing up of scientists across the globe to control these emerging diseases. This article reviews recent outbreaks in Pakistan and challenges for the development of an agile healthcare setup in the country.

Some North American species have declined due to factors that include habitat loss, parasites, pesticides, and climate change. In many regions conservation is hampered by lack of quantitative data on historical abundance and distribution, making status assessments difficult. From 2012 to 2014, with help from 53 citizen scientists, we conducted surveys to determine the status of bumble bees throughout Vermont, USA. For historical comparison, we identified and digitized bumble bee specimens from 13 public and private collections. Our dataset contained 12,319 records, which we separated into historic (1915-1999; n=1669) and modern (2000-2014; n=10,650) periods, with our survey contributing 94% of modern data. Of 17 species, four were not detected and four showed significant declines. Rarefaction indicated that both modern and historic datasets slightly underestimated known species richness, diversity, and abundance, but confirmed a strong decline for all three parameters. Declining species broadly accorded with those reported elsewhere in eastern North America, and included those in subgenera Bombus, Fervidobombus, and Psithyrus. Four species in the subgenus Pyrobombus (B. bimaculatus, B. impatiens, B. ternarius, and B. vagans) greatly increased in relative abundance in the modern period. Landscape factors such as road density, elevation, and land use strongly predicted distribution of some species. Species diversity was correlated positively with grasslands, and negatively with deciduous and mixed forest cover, while abundance was correlated positively with evergreen forest cover, yet negatively with deciduous forest.

Here, we investigate the apparent coexistence of the global amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) with Bombina variegata populations in The Netherlands over a 7-year period. We used a multi-season mark-recapture dataset and assessed potential drivers of coexistence (individual condition, environmental mediation and demographic compensation) at the individual and population levels. We show that even in a situation with a clear cost incurred by endemic Bd, population sizes remain largely stable. Current environmental conditions and an over-dispersed pathogen load probably stabilize disease dynamics, but as higher temperatures increase infection probability, changing environmental conditions, for example a climate-change-driven rise in temperature, could unbalance the current fragile host-pathogen equilibrium. Understanding the proximate mechanisms of such environmental mediation and of site-specific differences in infection dynamics can provide vital information for mitigation actions.

Considering the high socio-economic impact of the wine sector all over the world, in recent years, there has been an increase in work aiming to investigate the biodiversity of grapevine germplasm available for breeding programs. Various studies have shed light on the genetic diversity characterizing the germplasm from the cradle of V. vinifera domestication in Georgia (South Caucasus). Georgian germplasm is placed in a distinct cluster from the European one and possesses a rich diversity for many different traits, including eno-carpological and phenological traits; resistance to pathogens, such as oomycetes and phytoplasmas; resistance to abiotic stresses, such as sunburn. The aim of this review is to assess the potential of Georgian cultivars as a source of useful traits for breeding programs. The unique genetic and phenotypic aspects of Georgian germplasm were unraveled, to better understand the diversity and quality of the genetic resources available to viticulturists, as valuable resources for the coming climate change scenario.

On 3 July 2018, 238 freshly deposited fecal samples were collected from the calving grounds and analyzed by flotation technique to recover eggs, oocysts, and nematode larvae. All fecal samples demonstrated the presence of gastrointestinal parasites: 93% (221/238) had nematodes, 36% (86/238) had cestodes, and 99% (235/238) had coccidian oocysts. For each Tibetan antelope, mean (SD) parasite species richness was 3.4 (1.3). Coinfections with five parasite genera were found in 19% (45/238) of fecal samples. These results showed that prevalence of Trielwstrongyhis, Marshallagia, and Eimeria infections in these Tibetan antelopes were sufficiently high to suggest long-term monitoring be implemented because the climate there is becoming warmer and moisture is increasing, both presumably due to the influence of global warming which, in turn, may be contributing to increased infection risks with these parasites.

The sustainability of beekeeping is at risk through factors of global change such as habitat loss, as well as through the spread of infectious diseases. In China and other parts of Asia, beekeepers rely both on native Apis cerana and non-native Apis mellifera, putting bee populations at particular risk of disease emergence from multi-host pathogens. Indeed, two important honey bee parasites have emerged from East Asian honey bees, the mite Varroa destructor and the microsporidian Nosema ceranae. As V. destructor vectors viral bee diseases, we investigated whether another key bee pathogen, Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), may also have originated in East Asian honey bee populations. We use a large-scale survey of apiaries across China to investigate the prevalence and seasonality of DWV in managed A. mellifera and A. cerana colonies, showing that DWV-A prevalence was higher in A. mellifera, with a seasonal spike in prevalence in autumn and winter. Using phylogenetic and population genetic approaches, we show that while China and East Asian DWV isolates show comparatively high levels of genetic diversity, these bee populations are not a source for the current global DWV epidemic.

The role of infectious diseases in biological conservation	ANIMAL CONSERVATION				Review								Recent increases in the magnitude and rate of environmental change, including habitat loss, climate change and overexploitation, have been directly linked to the global loss of biodiversity. Wildlife extinction rates are estimated to be 100-1000 times greater than the historical norm, and up to 50% of higher taxonomic groups are critically endangered. While many types of environmental changes threaten the survival of species all over the planet, infectious disease has rarely been cited as the primary cause of global species extinctions. There is substantial evidence, however, that diseases can greatly impact local species populations by causing temporary or permanent declines in abundance. More importantly, pathogens can interact with other driving factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, overexploitation, invasive species and environmental pollution to contribute to local and global extinctions. Regrettably, our current lack of knowledge about the diversity and abundance of pathogens in natural systems has made it difficult to establish the relative importance of disease as a significant driver of species extinction, and the context when this is most likely to occur. Here, we review the role of infectious diseases in biological conservation. We summarize existing knowledge of disease-induced extinction at global and local scales and review the ecological and evolutionary forces that may facilitate disease-mediated extinction risk. We suggest that while disease alone may currently threaten few species, pathogens may be a significant threat to already-endangered species, especially when disease interacts with other drivers. We identify control strategies that may help reduce the negative effects of disease on wildlife and discuss the most critical challenges and future directions for the study of infectious diseases in the conservation sciences.

J	Sehgal, RNM				Sehgal, R. N. M.			Deforestation and avian infectious diseases	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				Article								In this time of unprecedented global change, infectious diseases will impact humans and wildlife in novel and unknown ways. Climate change, the introduction of invasive species, urbanization, agricultural practices and the loss of biodiversity have all been implicated in increasing the spread of infectious pathogens. In many regards, deforestation supersedes these other global events in terms of its immediate potential global effects in both tropical and temperate regions. The effects of deforestation on the spread of pathogens in birds are largely unknown. Birds harbor many of the same types of pathogens as humans and in addition can spread infectious agents to humans and other wildlife. It is thought that avifauna have gone extinct due to infectious diseases and many are presently threatened, especially endemic island birds. It is clear that habitat degradation can pose a direct threat to many bird species but it is uncertain how these alterations will affect disease transmission and susceptibility to disease. The migration and dispersal of birds can also change with habitat degradation, and thus expose populations to novel pathogens. Some recent work has shown that the results of landscape transformation can have confounding effects on avian malaria, other haemosporidian parasites and viruses. Now with advances in many technologies, including mathematical and computer modeling, genomics and satellite tracking, scientists have tools to further research the disease ecology of deforestation. This research will be imperative to help predict and prevent outbreaks that could affect avifauna, humans and other wildlife worldwide.

J	Galaktionov, KV				Galaktionov, K. V.			Patterns and processes influencing helminth parasites of Arctic coastal communities during climate change	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY				Review								This review analyses the scarce available data on biodiversity and transmission of helminths in Arctic coastal ecosystems and the potential impact of climate changes on them. The focus is on the helminths of seabirds, dominant parasites in coastal ecosystems. Their fauna in the Arctic is depauperate because of the lack of suitable intermediate hosts and unfavourable conditions for species with free-living larvae. An increasing proportion of crustaceans in the diet of Arctic seabirds would result in a higher infection intensity of cestodes and acanthocephalans, and may also promote the infection of seabirds with non-specific helminths. In this way, the latter may find favourable conditions for colonization of new hosts. Climate changes may alter the composition of the helminth fauna, their infection levels in hosts and ways of transmission in coastal communities. Immigration of boreal invertebrates and fish into Arctic seas may allow the circulation of helminths using them as intermediate hosts. Changing migratory routes of animals would alter the distribution of their parasites, facilitating, in particular, their trans-Arctic transfer. Prolongation of the seasonal transmission window' may increase the parasitic load on host populations. Changes in Arctic marine food webs would have an overriding influence on the helminths' circulation. This process may be influenced by the predicted decreased of salinity in Arctic seas, increased storm activity, coastal erosion, ocean acidification, decline of Arctic ice, etc. Greater parasitological research efforts are needed to assess the influence of factors related to Arctic climate change on the transmission of helminths.

Besides understanding the impact in the species, it has been advocated that answering if different traits will be differently impacted could allow refined predictions of how climate change will jeopardize biodiversity. Our aim was to evaluate if climate change will potentially impact plant species differently, considering their traits. We evaluated 608 plant species that occur in the naturally open areas of ferruginous outcrops (namely, cangas) in the National Forest of Carajas (Eastern Amazon). Firstly, we estimated the effects of climate change on each species using species distribution modeling, and analyzed this impact in the set containing all species. Secondly, we classified plant species considering the following traits: (i) pollination syndromes (melittophily, phalaenophily, psychophily, cantharophily, entomophily, ornithophily, chiropterophily, anemophily); (ii) habit (tree, shrub, herb, liana, parasite); and (iii) the main habitat of occurrence (open areas and forests). Thirdly, we investigated if the effects of climate change could be significantly more intense considering all the different traits quoted. Our results showed that most plant species will potentially face reduction of suitable habitats under future climate and the scenarios showed that 42% of them may not find suitable areas in the cangas of Carajas. We found no significant difference within each analyzed trait, considering the potential impact of climate change. The most climatically suitable areas (i.e., areas with high probability of species occurrence in the future) are those in the southwest of the study area. These areas can be considered as priority areas for species protection against climate change.

Parasite and pathogen effects on ecosystem processes: A quantitative review	ECOSPHERE				Article								Pathogens and parasites (henceforth "pathogens") can make up a large percentage of the biomass found in ecosystems, and therefore, their impacts on ecosystem processes should be prominent. Pathogens influence ecosystem processes by affecting the abundance or phenotype of hosts and through direct contributions to ecosystem production. However, there has been little quantitative synthesis of the relative effect sizes of these impacts on ecosystem processes. This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of pathogen effects on primary production, secondary production, and biogeochemical cycles. We find that the effects of pathogens on ecosystem processes were greater where pathogens influenced host or community abundance or biomass than when they influenced phenotypes. Pathogen impacts on primary production were larger than on secondary production or biogeochemical cycles. By contrast, we detected no general differences in effect sizes across host or pathogen taxon or ecosystem type (terrestrial vs. aquatic). While we have found potential evidence of publication bias against negative results, a well-known issue in meta-analyses, our work nonetheless shows that the available literature under-represents some taxa and geographic regions. To better understand the extent and magnitude of pathogen impacts on ecosystem processes, future research is needed in four areas. First, research is needed on the most understudied systems, including bacteria and viruses, as well as tropical ecosystems. A second priority is research seeking to understand how key components of ecosystem variation, including age (time of ecological continuity), productivity, and species diversity and composition, may interact to mediate pathogen impacts. Third, we suggest expanding on work examining how pathogen effects are influenced by climate change, species introductions, deforestation, and other human impacts. Fourth, we expect that host coinfection influences ecosystem processes in ways that cannot always be predicted based on studies of single infections. To enable others to build on this work, we make available the data we extracted from the literature, with the code for computing effect sizes.

This includes the geographic expansion of parasites; however, measuring the extent to which humans have influenced the dissemination and population structure of parasites has been challenging. In-depth comparisons among parasite populations extending to landscape-level processes affecting disease emergence have remained elusive. New research methods have enhanced our capacity to discern human impact, where the tools of population genetics and molecular epidemiology have begun to shed light on our historical and ongoing influence. Only since the 1990s have parasitologists coupled morphological diagnosis, long considered the basis of surveillance and biodiversity studies, with state-of-the-art tools enabling variation to be examined among, and within, parasite populations. Prior to this time, populations were characterized only by phenotypic attributes such as virulence, infectivity, host range, and geographical location. The advent of genetic/molecular methodologies (multilocus allozyme electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction-DNA [PCR-DNA] fragments analysis, DNA sequencing, DNA microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms, etc.) have transformed our abilities to reveal variation among, and within, populations at local, regional, landscape, and global scales, and thereby enhanced our understanding of the biosphere. Numerous factors can affect population structure among parasites, e. g., evolutionary and ecological history, mode of reproduction and transmission, host dispersal, and life-cycle complexity. Although such influences can vary considerably among parasite taxa, anthropogenic factors are demonstrably perturbing parasite fauna. Minimal genetic structure among many geographically distinct (isolated) populations is a hallmark of human activity, hastened by geographic introductions, environmental perturbation, and global warming. Accelerating environmental change now plays a primary role in defining where hosts, parasites, and other pathogens occur. This review examines how anthropogenic factors serve as drivers of globalization and genetic homogenization of parasite populations and demonstrates the impact that human intervention has had on the global dissemination of parasites and the accompanying diseases.

The future of marine biodiversity and marine ecosystem functioning in UK coastal and territorial waters (including UK Overseas Territories) - with an emphasis on marine macrophyte communities	BOTANICA MARINA				Review								Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning including seaweed communities - in the territorial waters of the UK and its Overseas Territories are facing unprecedented pressures. Key stressors are changes in ecosystem functioning due to biodiversity loss caused by ocean warming (species replacement and migration, e.g. affecting kelp forests), sea level rise (e.g. loss of habitats including salt marshes), plastic pollution (e.g. entanglement and ingestion), alien species with increasing numbers of alien seaweeds (e.g. outcompeting native species and parasite transmission), overexploitation (e.g. loss of energy supply further up the food web), habitat destruction (e.g. loss of nursery areas for commercially important species) and ocean acidification (e.g. skeletal weakening of ecosystem engineers including coralline algal beds). These stressors are currently affecting biodiversity, and their impact can be projected for the future. All stressors may act alone or in synergy. Marine biodiversity provides crucial goods and services. Climate change and biodiversity loss pose new challenges for legislation. In particular, there are implications of climate change for the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas and natural carbon storage by marine systems to help control the global climate system. The UK currently has legal obligations to protect biodiversity under international and European law.

It is imperative to predict the global distribution of Culicoides imicola (C. imicola), which was the main vector of African horse sickness virus. Methods: The occurrence records of C. imicola were mainly obtained from the published literature and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database. The maximum entropy algorithm was used to model the current distribution suitability and future dynamics of C. imicola under climate change scenarios. Results: The modeling results showed that the currently suitable habitats for C. imicola were distributed in most of the southern part areas of America, southwestern Europe, most of Africa, the coastal areas of the Middle East, almost all regions of South Asia, southern China, a few countries in Southeast Asia, and the whole Australia. Our model also revealed the important environmental variables on the distribution of C. imicola were temperature seasonality, precipitation of coldest quarter, and mean temperature of wettest quarter. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) is an assumption of possible greenhouse gases emissions in the future. Under future climate change scenarios, the area of habitat suitability increased and decreased with time, and RCP 8.5 in the 2070s gave the worst prediction. Moreover, the habitat suitability of C. imicola will likely expand to higher latitudes. The prediction of this study is of strategic significance for vector surveillance and the prevention of vector-borne diseases.

Despite technological breakthroughs, we are losing the battle with (re)emerging diseases as treatment costs and production losses rise. A horizon scan of diseases of crops, livestock, seafood and food-borne illness suggests these costs are unsustainable. The paradigm of coevolution between pathogens and particular hosts teaches that emerging diseases occur only when pathogens evolve specific capacities that allow them to move to new hosts. EIDs ought to be rare and unpredictable, so crisis response is the best we can do. Alternatively, the Stockholm Paradigm suggests that the world is full of susceptible but unexposed hosts that pathogens could infect, given the opportunity. Global climate change, globalized trade and travel, urbanization and land-use changes (often associated with biodiversity loss) increase those opportunities, making EID frequent. We can, however, anticipate their arrival in new locations and their behaviour once they have arrived. We can 'find them before they find us', mitigating their impacts. The DAMA (Document, Assess, Monitor, Act) protocol alters the current reactive stance and embodies proactive solutions to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of EID, extending human and material resources and buying time for development of new vaccinations, medications and control measures.

Ash dieback due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus: what can be learnt from evolutionary ecology?	PLANT PATHOLOGY				Review								The future existence of common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), an important tree species throughout temperate Europe, is threatened. An invasive fungal disease (ash dieback) has spread through much of the distribution area of common ash. The causal agent of the disease is Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, a necrotrophic ascomycete, most probably introduced from Asia in the early 1990s. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus infects ash trees and saplings through their leaves, from which it grows into the stem. The fungus was studied intensively in recent years but there is still a need to address the topic from an evolutionary perspective. In this overview, some key evolutionary aspects of ash dieback are discussed, from the Red Queen dynamics of host-pathogen interactions to the probable consequences for virulence evolution of multiple infections. The progression of ash dieback in Europe does not show spatial differences, but studies show variation in susceptibility within host populations, a probable consequence of genetic differences, thus providing material for evolution of disease resistance or tolerance. Breeding programmes need to maintain the genetic diversity of Fraxinus, to enable it to withstand further threats such as climate change and the emerald ash borer. Because H.fraxineus reproduces exclusively sexually, the pathogen is likely to overcome a narrow genetic resistance. The introduction of further strains of H.fraxineus to Europe and the movement of infected plant material should be avoided. This case study shows that the integration of evolutionary ecology considerations would benefit plant disease management and biosecurity in general.

Agricultural Management Affects the Active Rhizosphere Bacterial Community Composition and Nitrification	MSYSTEMS				Article								Cropping system diversity provides yield benefits that may result from shifts in the composition of root-associated bacterial and fungal communities, which either enhance nutrient availability or limit nutrient loss. We investigated whether temporal diversity of annual cropping systems (four versus two crops in rotation) influences the composition and metabolic activities of root-associated microbial communities in maize at a developmental stage when the peak rate of nitrogen uptake occurs. We monitored total (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) bacterial communities and total (DNA-based) fungal communities in the soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere. Cropping system diversity strongly influenced the composition of the soil microbial communities, which influenced the recruitment of the resident microbial communities and, in particular, the potentially active rhizosphere and endosphere bacterial communities. The diversified cropping system rhizosphere recruited a more diverse bacterial community (species richness), even though there was little difference in soil species richness between the two cropping systems. In contrast, fungal species richness was greater in the conventional rhizosphere, which was enriched in fungal pathogens; the diversified rhizosphere, however, was enriched in Glomeromycetes. While cropping system influenced endosphere community composition, greater correspondence between DNA-and RNA-based profiles suggests a higher representation of active bacterial populations. Cropping system diversity influenced the composition of ammonia oxidizers, which coincided with diminished potential nitrification activity and gross nitrate production rates, particularly in the rhizosphere. The results of our study suggest that diversified cropping systems shift the composition of the rhizosphere's active bacterial and total fungal communities, resulting in tighter coupling between plants and microbial processes that influence nitrogen acquisition and retention. IMPORTANCE Crops in simplified, low-diversity agroecosystems assimilate only a fraction of the inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs. Much of this N fertilizer is lost to the environment as N oxides, which degrade water quality and contribute to climate change and loss of biodiversity. Ecologically inspired management may facilitate mutualistic interactions between plant roots and microbes to liberate nutrients when plants need them, while also decreasing nutrient loss and pathogen pressure. In this study, we investigate the effects of a conventional (2-year rotation, inorganic fertilization) and a diversified (4-year rotation, manure amendments) cropping system on the assembly of bacterial and fungal root-associated communities, at a maize developmental stage when nitrogen demand is beginning to increase. Our results indicate that agricultural management influences the recruitment of root-associated microbial communities and that diversified cropping systems have lower rates of nitrification (particularly in the rhizosphere), thereby reducing the potential for loss of nitrate from these systems.

This study provides background information on India's Western Himalayas and reviews evidence of warming as well as variability in precipitation and extreme events. Methods: Understanding and anticipating the impacts of climate change on Himalayan forest ecosystems and the services they provide to people are critical. Efforts to develop and implement effective policies and management strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation requires particular new research initiatives. The various studies initiated and conducted in the region are compiled here. Results: Several new initiatives taken by the Himalayan Forest Research Institute in Shimla are described. This includes new permanent observational field studies, some with mapped trees, in high altitude transitional zones for continuous monitoring of vegetation response. We have also presented new strategies for mitigating potential climate change effects in Himalayan forest ecosystems. Conclusions: Assessment of the ecological and genetic diversity of the Himalayan conifers is required to evaluate potential responses to changing climatic conditions. Conservation strategies for the important temperate medicinal plants need to be developed. The impact of climate change on insects and pathogens in the Himalayas also need to be assessed. Coordinated efforts are necessary to develop effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation.

Nature and COVID-19: The pandemic, the environment, and the way ahead	AMBIO				Article								The COVID-19 pandemic has brought profound social, political, economic, and environmental challenges to the world. The virus may have emerged from wildlife reservoirs linked to environmental disruption, was transmitted to humans via the wildlife trade, and its spread was facilitated by economic globalization. The pandemic arrived at a time when wildfires, high temperatures, floods, and storms amplified human suffering. These challenges call for a powerful response to COVID-19 that addresses social and economic development, climate change, and biodiversity together, offering an opportunity to bring transformational change to the structure and functioning of the global economy. This biodefense can include a "One Health" approach in all relevant sectors; a greener approach to agriculture that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and leads to healthier diets; sustainable forms of energy; more effective international environmental agreements; post-COVID development that is equitable and sustainable; and nature-compatible international trade. Restoring and enhancing protected areas as part of devoting 50% of the planet's land to environmentally sound management that conserves biodiversity would also support adaptation to climate change and limit human contact with zoonotic pathogens. The essential links between human health and well-being, biodiversity, and climate change could inspire a new generation of innovators to provide green solutions to enable humans to live in a healthy balance with nature leading to a long-term resilient future.

J	David, JF; Handa, IT				David, Jean-Francois; Handa, Ira Tanya			The ecology of saprophagous macroarthropods (millipedes, woodlice) in the context of global change	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				Review								Millipedes (Diplopoda) and woodlice (Crustacea, Isopoda), with a total of about 15000 described species worldwide, contribute substantially to invertebrate biodiversity. These saprophagous macroarthropods, which are key regulators of plant litter decomposition, play an important role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems in tropical and temperate areas. Herein we review current knowledge on the effects of climate, food quality and land cover on millipede and woodlouse species to explore their potential responses to global change. Essentially similar trends are observed in the two taxa. Experiments have shown that climate warming could result in higher rates of population growth and have positive effects on the abundance of some temperate species. This is consistent with signs of northward expansion in Europe, although the mechanisms of dispersal remain unclear. The generality of this finding is evaluated in relation to the life histories and geographical distributions of species. At low latitudes, interactions with more severe droughts are likely and could affect community composition. Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and changes in plant community composition are expected to alter leaf litter quality, a major determinant of macroarthropod fertility via the link with female adult body size. Although food quality changes have been shown to influence population growth rates significantly, it is proposed that the effects of warming will be probably more important during the coming decades. Land cover changes, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and land abandonment in Europe, are critical to habitat specialists and could override any other effect of global change. Habitat destruction by man may be the main threat to macroarthropod species, many of which are narrow endemics. At the landscape scale, habitat heterogeneity could be a good option for conservation, even at the cost of some fragmentation. Two principal areas are identified which require further work: (i) the effects of climate change across broader geographic ranges, and on species with different ecologies and life histories; (ii) the effects of global change on both macroarthropods and their natural enemies (predators, parasites and pathogens), to improve predictions in field situations.

The Role of Interferon Antagonist, Non-Structural Proteins in the Pathogenesis and Emergence of Arboviruses	VIRUSES-BASEL				Review								A myriad of factors favor the emergence and re-emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), including migration, climate change, intensified livestock production, an increasing volume of international trade and transportation, and changes to ecosystems (e. g., deforestation and loss of biodiversity). Consequently, arboviruses are distributed worldwide and represent over 30% of all emerging infectious diseases identified in the past decade. Although some arboviral infections go undetected or are associated with mild, flu-like symptoms, many are important human and veterinary pathogens causing serious illnesses such as arthritis, gastroenteritis, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever and devastating economic loss as a consequence of lost productivity and high mortality rates among livestock. One of the most consistent molecular features of emerging arboviruses, in addition to their near exclusive use of RNA genomes, is the inclusion of viral, non-structural proteins that act as interferon antagonists. In this review, we describe these interferon antagonists and common strategies that arboviruses use to counter the host innate immune response. In addition, we discuss the complex interplay between host factors and viral determinants that are associated with virus emergence and re-emergence, and identify potential targets for vaccine and anti-viral therapies.

Seasonal activity, vector relationships and genetic analysis of mosquito-borne Stratford virus	PLOS ONE				Article								There are many gaps to be filled in our understanding of mosquito-borne viruses, their relationships with vectors and reservoir hosts, and the environmental drivers of seasonal activity. Stratford virus (STRV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus and has been isolated from mosquitoes and infected humans in Australia but little is known of its vector and reservoir host associations. A total of 43 isolates of STRV from mosquitoes collected in New South Wales between 1995 and 2013 was examined to determine the genetic diversity between virus isolates and their relationship with mosquito species. The virus was isolated from six mosquito species; Aedes aculeatus, Aedes alternans, Aedes notoscriptus, Aedes procax, Aedes vigilax, and Anopheles annulipes. While there were distinct differences in temporal and spatial activity of STRV, with peaks of activity in 2006, 2010 and 2013, a sequence homology of 95.9%-98.4% was found between isolates and the 1961 STRV prototype with 96.2%-100% identified among isolates. Temporal differences but no apparent nucleotide divergence by mosquito species or geographic location was evident. The result suggests the virus is geographically widespread in NSW (albeit only from coastal regions) and increased local STRV activity is likely to be driven by reservoir host factors and local environmental conditions influencing vector abundance. While STRV may not currently be associated with major outbreaks of human disease, with the potential for urbanisation and climate change to increase mosquito-borne disease risks, and the possibility of genomic changes which could produce pathogenic strains, understanding the drivers of STRV activity may assist the development of strategic response to public health risks posed by zoonotic flaviviruses in Australia.

Colonization of muskoxen by P. stilesi may be a predictable event in zones of sympatry with Dall's sheep; exposure to infection may coincide with occupation of winter ranges of Dull's sheep by muskoxen during the summer season. Disruption of contemporary ecological isolating barriers can result from anthropogenically or climatologically driven habitat perturbation, and result from management practices that influence the distribution of ungulate hosts. Thus, if zones of contact become more extensive or the temporal limits on allopatry are relaxed, we may observe increasing instances of host switching by parasites or pathogens at the interface of newly emerging ecotones. Impacts to northern systems linked to climatologically and anthropogenically driven global change and the effects of management must be tracked within the context of biodiversity survey and inventory and archival collections, as foundations for monitoring ecosystem-level perturbations. A developing interface for muskoxen, wild sheep, and parasites along the Mackenzie River ecotone represents a natural model or Field laboratory to examine these processes. Additonally, lungworms, Protostrongylus spp., had not been reported in muskoxen, and a new geographic record for this nematode was established in Dall's sheep from the northern Richardson Mountains, NT.

The impact of Bd on amphibians is determined by the host's immune system, of which the skin microbiome is a critical component. The richness and diversity of such cutaneous bacterial communities are known to be shaped by abiotic factors which thus may indirectly modulate host susceptibility to Bd. This study aimed to contribute to understanding the environment-host-pathogen interaction determining skin bacterial communities in 819 treefrogs (Anura: Hylidae and Phyllomedusidae) from 71 species sampled across the AF. We investigated whether abiotic factors influence the bacterial community richness and structure on the amphibian skin. We further tested for an association between skin bacterial community structure and Bd co-occurrence. Our data revealed that temperature, precipitation, and elevation consistently correlate with richness and diversity of the skin microbiome and also predict Bd infection status. Surprisingly, our data suggest a weak but significant positive correlation of Bd infection intensity and bacterial richness. We highlight the prospect of future experimental studies on the impact of changing environmental conditions associated with global change on environment-host-pathogen interactions in the AF.

Plant-soil biota interactions play a crucial role in the assembly of plant communities and the maintenance of plant species diversity. However, few studies have tested how the effect of soil biota on plant species and communities depends on environmental context and whether shifts in plant community composition caused by environmental change are associated with variation in plant-soil biota interactions. 2. We combined a field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow and a greenhouse experiment with factorial combinations of nitrogen (N) enrichment and warming to examine the role of plant-soil biota interactions in plant community dynamics. 3. The results showed that plant relative abundances were negatively correlated with the net effects of soil biota on plant growth but only under ambient field conditions. Warming and N enrichment alleviated the negative soil biota effects in the greenhouse, and changed plant community composition and reduced species diversity in the field. Importantly, changes in soil biota effects on plant growth were positively correlated with changes in plant relative abundances caused by warming and N enrichment in field. In a parallel field experiment, the diversity of mycorrhizal fungi increased while the diversity of fungal pathogens remained unchanged under warming and N enrichment, indicating that soil biodiversity may play a critical role in plant responses to environmental change. 4. This study empirically demonstrates that altered plant-soil biota interactions explain shifts in plant community composition under global change, providing new insights into the mechanisms of diversity loss in a changing world.

B.; Beier, John C.; Benelli, Giovanni			Complexity of the relationship between global warming and urbanization - an obscure future for predicting increases in vector-borne infectious diseases	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE				Review								Arthropod vectors are responsible for the transmission of many infectious diseases. Currently, more than three billion people living in endemic areas are exposed to vector-borne pathogens. Substantial differences in the biology of arthropod vectors make it extremely challenging to predict the incidence of vector-borne diseases in the future. However, global warming and urbanization both profoundly affect the ecology and distribution of arthropod vectors. Such processes often result in a biotic homogenization of species in a non-random process of biodiversity loss. The data presently available indicate a trend towards progressive increases in the presence and abundance of vectors capable of thriving in urban environments amongst humans, thus, increasing the contact between vectors and human hosts. As a consequence, we expect the incidence of vector-borne diseases to increase. In our opinion, resources should be made available and directed to strategies within the Integrated Vector Management framework, focusing on proven vector control tools. Besides, a substantial reduction of IVM costs would be achieved by observing environmental guidelines and providing basic sanitary infrastructure at early stages of its development. This could help to increase IVM effectiveness in attenuating social determinants of health and social inequities due to exposure to vectors.	[Wilke, Andre B.

Cross-continental comparison of parasite communities in a wide-ranging carnivore suggests associations with prey diversity and host density	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Article								Parasites are integral to ecosystem functioning yet often overlooked. Improved understanding of host-parasite associations is important, particularly for wide-ranging species for which host range shifts and climate change could alter host-parasite interactions and their effects on ecosystem function. Among the most widely distributed mammals with diverse diets, gray wolves (Canis lupus) host parasites that are transmitted among canids and via prey species. Wolf-parasite associations may therefore influence the population dynamics and ecological functions of both wolves and their prey. Our goal was to identify large-scale processes that shape host-parasite interactions across populations, with the wolf as a model organism. By compiling data from various studies, we examined the fecal prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in six wolf populations from two continents in relation to wolf density, diet diversity, and other ecological conditions. As expected, we found that the fecal prevalence of parasites transmitted directly to wolves via contact with other canids or their excreta was positively associated with wolf density. Contrary to our expectations, the fecal prevalence of parasites transmitted via prey was negatively associated with prey diversity. We also found that parasite communities reflected landscape characteristics and specific prey items available to wolves. Several parasite taxa identified in this study, including hookworms and coccidian protozoans, can cause morbidity and mortality in canids, especially in pups, or in combination with other stressors. The density-prevalence relationship for parasites with simple life cycles may reflect a regulatory role of gastrointestinal parasites on wolf populations. Our result that fecal prevalence of parasites was lower in wolves with more diverse diets could provide insight into the mechanisms by which biodiversity may regulate disease. A diverse suite of predator-prey interactions could regulate the effects of parasitism on prey populations and mitigate the transmission of infectious agents, including zoonoses, spread via trophic interactions.

Resilience of marine turtle regional management units to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Enhancing species resilience to changing environmental conditions is often suggested as a climate change adaptation strategy. To effectively achieve this, it is necessary first to understand the factors that determine species resilience, and their relative importance in shaping the ability of species to adjust to the complexities of environmental change. This is an extremely challenging task because it requires comprehensive information on species traits. We explored the resilience of 58 marine turtle regional management units (RMUs) to climate change, encompassing all seven species of marine turtles worldwide. We used expert opinion from the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group (n=33 respondents) to develop a Resilience Index, which considered qualitative characteristics of each RMU (relative population size, rookery vulnerability, and genetic diversity) and non climate-related threats (fisheries, take, coastal development, and pollution/pathogens). Our expert panel perceived rookery vulnerability (the likelihood of functional rookeries becoming extirpated) and non climate-related threats as having the greatest influence on resilience of RMUs to climate change. We identified the world's 13 least resilient marine turtle RMUs to climate change, which are distributed within all three major ocean basins and include six of the world's seven species of marine turtle. Our study provides the first look at inter- and intra-species variation in resilience to climate change and highlights the need to devise metrics that measure resilience directly. We suggest that this approach can be widely used to help prioritize future actions that increase species resilience to climate change.	[Fuentes, Mariana M. P.

(Poaceae) response to grazing	PLOS ONE				Article								Grassland is one of the most widely-distributed ecosystems on Earth and provides a variety of ecosystem services. Grasslands, however, currently suffer from severe degradation induced by human activities, overgrazing pressure and climate change. In the present study, we explored the transcriptome response of Stipa breviflora, a dominant species in the desert steppe, to grazing through transcriptome sequencing, the development of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and analysis of genetic diversity. De novo assembly produced 111,018 unigenes, of which 88,164 (79.41%) unigenes were annotated. A total of 686 unigenes showed significantly different expression under grazing, including 304 and 382 that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the "alpha-linolenic acid metabolism" and "plant-pathogen interaction" pathways. Based on transcriptome sequencing data, we developed eight SSR molecular markers and investigated the genetic diversity of S. breviflora in grazed and ungrazed sites. We found that a relatively high level of S. breviflora genetic diversity occurred under grazing. The findings of genes that improve resistance to grazing are helpful for the restoration, conservation, and management of desert steppe.

Phytopathogens promote tree-species coexistence by disproportionately afflicting seedlings of locally abundant species, generating a rare species advantage. We consider whether increased plant-pathogen interactions in humid conditions favourable for phytopathogens could drive the precipitation-richness relationship by accentuating the rare species advantage. Support for this mechanism requires that increases in disease under humid conditions disproportionately affect locally abundant species without spreading to rarer species. This criterion would be augmented by either increased phytopathogen host-specificity under humid conditions, or increased asynchronicity in germination of different tree species. Research suggests that precipitation increases the rare species advantage. Increased precipitation enhances phytopathogen transmission, making escape from specialist pathogens more difficult. Additionally, drought stress predisposes plants to disease, especially by opportunistic pathogens. As seasonality in wet forests decreases, scope for asynchronous germination among species increases, potentially concentrating disease transmission within species. Synthesis. The pathways we identify could drive the precipitation-richness relationship, but finding direct evidence for them remains a priority. Researching these pathways is especially important because decreasing precipitation due to climate change could disrupt key species coexistence mechanisms and erode tree-species richness.

Linking global climate and temperature variability to widespread amphibian declines putatively caused by disease	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				Article								The role of global climate change in the decline of biodiversity and the emergence of infectious diseases remains controversial, and the effect of climatic variability, in particular, has largely been ignored. For instance, it was recently revealed that the proposed link between climate change and widespread amphibian declines, putatively caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), was tenuous because it was based on a temporally confounded correlation. Here we provide temporally unconfounded evidence that global El Nino climatic events drive widespread amphibian losses in genus Atelopus via increased regional temperature variability, which can reduce amphibian defenses against pathogens. Of 26 climate variables tested, only factors associated with temperature variability could account for the spatiotemporal patterns of declines thought to be associated with Bd. Climatic predictors of declines became significant only after controlling for a pattern consistent with epidemic spread ( by temporally detrending the data). This presumed spread accounted for 59% of the temporal variation in amphibian losses, whereas El Nino accounted for 59% of the remaining variation. Hence, we could account for 83% of the variation in declines with these two variables alone. Given that global climate change seems to increase temperature variability, extreme climatic events, and the strength of Central Pacific El Nino episodes, climate change might exacerbate worldwide enigmatic declines of amphibians, presumably by increasing susceptibility to disease. These results suggest that changes to temperature variability associated with climate change might be as significant to biodiversity losses and disease emergence as changes to mean temperature.

Climate warming alters the structure of farmland tritrophic ecological networks and reduces crop yield	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				Article								It is unclear how sustained increases in temperature and changes in precipitation, as a result of climate change, will affect crops and their interactions with agricultural weeds, insect pests and predators, due to the difficulties in quantifying changes in such complex relationships. We simulated the combined effects of increasing temperature (by an average of 1.4 degrees C over a growing season) and applying additional rainwater (10% of the monthly mean added weekly, 40% total) using a replicated, randomized block experiment within a wheat crop. We examined how this affected the structure of 24 quantitative replicate plant-aphid-parasitoid networks constructed using DNA-based methods. Simulated climate warming affected species richness, significantly altered consumer-resource asymmetries and reduced network complexity. Increased temperature induced an aphid outbreak, but the parasitism rates of aphids by parasitoid wasps remained unchanged. It also drove changes in the crop, altering in particular the phenology of the wheat as well as its quality (i.e., fewer, lighter seeds).

Mortality Rates Differ Among Amphibian Populations Exposed to Three Strains of a Lethal Ranavirus	ECOHEALTH				Article								Infectious diseases are a growing threat to biodiversity, in many cases because of synergistic effects with habitat loss, environmental contamination, and climate change. Emergence of pathogens as new threats to host populations can also arise when novel combinations of hosts and pathogens are unintentionally brought together, for example, via commercial trade or wildlife relocations and reintroductions. Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and amphibian ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae) are pathogens implicated in global amphibian declines. The emergence of disease associated with these pathogens appears to be at least partly related to recent translocations over large geographic distances. We experimentally examined the outcomes of novel combinations of host populations and pathogen strains using the amphibian ranavirus Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) and barred tiger salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium, formerly considered part of the Ambystoma tigrinum complex). One salamander population was highly resistant to lethal infections by all ATV strains, including its own strain, and mortality rates differed among ATV strains according to salamander population. Mortality rates in novel pairings of salamander population and ATV strain were not predictable based on knowledge of mortality rates when salamander populations were exposed to their own ATV strain. The underlying cause(s) for the differences in mortality rates are unknown, but local selection pressures on salamanders, viruses, or both, across the range of this widespread host-pathogen system are a plausible hypothesis. Our study highlights the need to minimize translocations of amphibian ranaviruses, even among conspecifc host populations, and the importance of considering intraspecific variation in endeavors to manage wildlife diseases.

How many hosts?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				Article								Estimates of the total number of species that inhabit the Earth have increased significantly since Linnaeus's initial catalog of 20,000 species. The best recent estimates suggest that there are approximate to 6 million species. More emphasis has been placed on counts of free-living species than on parasitic species. We rectify this by quantifying the numbers and proportion of parasitic species. We estimate that there are between 75,000 and 300,600 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates. We have no credible way of estimating how many parasitic protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses exist. We estimate that between 3% and 5% of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next 50 to 100 years. Because patterns of parasite diversity do not clearly map onto patterns of host diversity, we can make very little prediction about geographical patterns of threat to parasites. If the threats reflect those experienced by avian hosts, then we expect climate change to be a major threat to the relatively small proportion of parasite diversity that lives in the polar and temperate regions, whereas habitat destruction will be the major threat to tropical parasite diversity. Recent studies of food webs suggest that approximate to 75% of the links in food webs involve a parasitic species; these links are vital for regulation of host abundance and potentially for reducing the impact of toxic pollutants. This implies that parasite extinctions may have unforeseen costs that impact the health and abundance of a large number of free-living species.

Investigating these genetic patterns is important, as they may reveal obscured processes and players. The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia is among the most widespread symbionts in insects. Wolbachia typically spreads within host species by conferring direct fitness benefits, and/or by manipulating its host reproduction to favour infected over uninfected females. Under sufficient selective advantage, the mitochondrial haplotype associated with the favoured maternally-inherited symbiotic strains will spread (i.e. hitchhike), resulting in low mitochondrial genetic variation across the host species range. Method The common bluetail damselfly (Ischnura elegans: van der Linden, 1820) has recently emerged as a model organism for genetics and genomic signatures of range expansion during climate change. Although there is accumulating data on the consequences of such expansion on the genetics of I. elegans, no study has screened for Wolbachia in the damselfly genus Ischnura. Here, we present the biogeographic variation in Wolbachia prevalence and penetrance across Europe and Japan (including samples from 17 populations), and from close relatives in the Mediterranean area (i.e. I. genei: Rambur, 1842; and I. saharensis: Aguesse, 1958). Results Our data reveal (a) multiple Wolbachia-strains, (b) potential transfer of the symbiont through hybridization, (c) higher infection rates at higher latitudes, and (d) reduced mitochondrial diversity in the north-west populations, indicative of hitchhiking associated with the selective sweep of the most common strain. We found low mitochondrial haplotype diversity in the Wolbachia-infected north-western European populations (Sweden, Scotland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy) of I. elegans, and, conversely, higher mitochondrial diversity in populations with low penetrance of Wolbachia (Ukraine, Greece, Montenegro and Cyprus). The timing of the selective sweep associated with infected lineages was estimated between 20,000 and 44,000 years before present, which is consistent with the end of the last glacial period about 20,000 years. Conclusions Our findings provide an example of how endosymbiont infections can shape spatial variation in their host evolutionary genetics during postglacial expansion. These results also challenge population genetic studies that do not consider the prevalence of symbionts in many insects, which we show can impact geographic patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity.

J	Cullings, K; Hanely, J				Cullings, Ken; Hanely, Julia			Dwarf mistletoe effects on soil basidiomycete community structure, soil fungal functional diversity, and soil enzyme function: Implications for climate change	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY				Article								We used a combination of molecular, culture and biochemical methods to test the hypothesis that severe infection of pine by dwarf mistletoe (genus Arceuthobium) has significant effects on structure and function of soil fungal communities, and on carbon cycling in soils. PLR and DNA sequencing of the basidiomycete communities in paired blocks of uninfected and infected trees revealed: (1) that the top, organic soil layer in this system is inhabited almost exclusively by ectomycorrhizal fungi; (2) no difference in species richness (6 species core(-1) in both) or Shannon-Wiener evenness (0.740 and 0.747 in uninfected and infected blocks respectively), however Shannon-Wiener diversity was significantly greater in infected blocks (1.19 vs 1.94 in uninfected and infected blocks respectively, P < 0.05); (3) significant differences in basidiomycete species composition, with nearly complete absence of two system co-dominant Russula species in infected blocks, and replacement of one co-dominant Piloderma species with another in infected plots, indicating physiological variability within the genus. Soil fungal physiological diversity measured using the Fungilog system was significantly greater in terms of both number of carbon substrates used by culturable soil fungi (both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes) in infected blocks, and the rate at which these substrates were used. Soil enzyme assays revealed greater laccase, peroxidase, and cellulase activities in soils associated with infected trees. Thus, event cascades associated with severe dwarf mistletoe infection not only significantly affected soil fungal species composition and increased species diversity, but also impacted on carbon-related function and functional diversity. Given the geographic range of this pathogen, and forecasts that epidemics of this disease will increase in range in severity with global climate change, these effects have the potential to significantly impact local and global carbon budgets.

Here, we used cavity-nesting communities of bees, wasps and their antagonists to reveal the role of temperature, food resources, parasitism rate and land use as drivers of species richness at different trophic levels along a broad elevational gradient. Location Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Taxon Cavity-nesting Hymenoptera (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Colletidae, Megachilidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, Pompilidae, Vespidae). Methods We established trap nests on 25 study sites that were distributed over similar large distances in terms of elevation along an elevational gradient from 866 to 1788 m a.s.l., including both natural and disturbed habitats. We quantified species richness and abundance of bees, wasps and antagonists, parasitism rates and flower or arthropod food resources. Data were analysed with generalized linear models within a multi-model inference framework. Results Elevational species richness patterns changed with trophic level from monotonically declining richness of bees to increasingly humped-shaped patterns for caterpillar-hunting wasps, spider-hunting wasps and antagonists. Parasitism rates generally declined with elevation but were higher for wasps than for bees. Temperature was the most important predictor of both bee and wasp host richness patterns. Antagonist richness patterns were also well predicted by temperature, but in contrast to host richness patterns, additionally by resource abundance and diversity. The conversion of natural habitats through anthropogenic land use, which included biomass removal, agricultural inputs, vegetation structure and percentage of surrounding agricultural habitats, had no significant effects on bee and wasp communities. Main conclusions Our study underpins the importance of temperature as a main driver of diversity gradients in ectothermic organisms and reveals the increasingly important role of food resources at higher trophic levels. Higher parasitism rates at higher trophic levels and at higher temperatures indicated that the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down drivers of species richness change across trophic levels and may respond differently to future climate change.

Micro- and macroparasite species richness in birds: The role of host life history and ecology	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				Article								Identifying the factors shaping variation in parasite diversity among host species is crucial to understand wildlife diseases. Although micro- and macroparasites may exert different selective pressures on their hosts, studies investigating the determinants of parasite species richness in animals have rarely considered this divide. Here, we investigated the role of host life history and ecology in explaining the species richness of helminths (macroparasites) and haemosporidians (microparasites) in birds world-wide. We collated data from multiple global datasets on diverse bird traits (longevity, body mass, coloniality, migration distance/tendency, geographic range size and dietary and habitat breadths) and the species richness of their helminth and haemosporidian parasites. We tested predictors of helminth and haemosporidian parasite richness using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. We found that, after controlling for research effort and host phylogeny, the richness of helminths, but not of haemosporidians, increased with host longevity, range size, migration distance and dietary breadth. Overall, these correlates were also important across different helminth groups (acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes and trematodes), and two additional ones (body mass, coloniality) emerged as important for cestodes and acanthocephalans. We propose that long life spans may promote the diversity of helminth parasite assemblages over evolutionary time, thus resulting in richer helminth faunas. Similarly, longer-distance migrations, larger ranges and broader dietary breadths are likely to lead to greater encounter rates and the accumulation of trophically transmitted helminths. In contrast, vector-borne haemosporidians may be influenced more by factors related to vector ecology than by the host traits included in the analyses. The lack of strong associations between haemosporidian species richness and host characteristics emphasizes the need to find appropriate traits to model the distribution and diversity of parasites with different environmental preferences in order to anticipate disease emergence risks associated with global change.

For arthropods, several studies have demonstrated how changing climates affect their distribution through phenological and physiological responses, largely focusing on various organismal fitness parameters. However, the net-effect of the changing climate among ecological communities may be mediated by the feedback pathways among interacting trophic groups under environmental change. For agroecosystems, the maintenance of the integrity of trophic interactions even under climate variability is a high priority. This is even more important in this era where there is advocacy for sustainable agriculture, with higher emphasis on environmentally benign methods. For this reason, pest management in food production systems using biological control (especially use of parasitoid antagonists) has come to the forefront. In this review, we give an overview of the diversity of physiological responses among host insect and parasitoid populations and how this may influence their interactions. We highlight how climate change may modify bottom-up and top-down factors among agroecosystems with a particular focus on plant-insect host-parasitoid tritrophic interactions. We also outline how habitat management may influence arthropod population dynamics and how it can be manipulated to improve on-farm climate resilience and parasitoid conservation. We wrap-up by highlighting how the application of knowledge of conservation biodiversity, designing of multifunctional resilient landscapes, and evolutionary physiology of arthropods under thermal stress may be used to improve the fitness of mass-reared parasitoids (in or ex situ) for the improvement in efficacy of parasitoids ecosystem services under thermally stressful environments	[Chidawanyika, Frank] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Mudavanhu, Pride] Agr Res Council, Plant Hlth Protect, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Mudavanhu, Pride] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Nyamukondiwa, Casper] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Palapye, Botswana		Chidawanyika, F (corresponding author), Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, Bloemfontein, South Africa.

The global ecology of human population density and interpreting changes in paleo-population density	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE				Article								Explaining variation in human population density constitutes a basic research problem in human ecology and archaeological science. To contribute to this basic research problem, we build a graphic model and conduct a global analysis of the effects of ecological variables, controlling for technological differences, on human population density. Our results indicate that human population density displays a consistent relationship with ecological variables across productive technologies. Human population density peaks in high productivity environments with moderate levels of species richness and moderate to low levels of pathogens among hunter-gatherer, subsistence agricultural, and industrial societies. Population density is lower in low productivity environments as well as environments with high productivity, high species richness and high pathogen loads. The productive technologies associated with agriculture and industrial production impact human population density more than ecological variables, and shifts toward agriculture or industrial production may weaken the effect of net primary productivity on population density. These results illustrate the nature of the relationship between population density and ecological variables, which are partly driven by climate, and the results provide a basis for hypotheses that researchers can use to analyze the potential effects of climate change on material record estimates of human paleo-population density.

This approach is particularly relevant for bats because their nocturnal behaviour hinders detectability and identification in flight. Despite their important contribution to global biodiversity and wide geographical ranges, bats have been under-represented in early SDM studies, and only in the last few years has this approach become more widely used in bat research. We carried out a meta-analysis of the published literature to review the history of the use of SDMs in bat research and their application in conservation, climate change assessments and genetic studies. We focus on the geographical coverage, theme and modelling algorithm of published studies, and compare studies that are uniquely dedicated to bats to multi-taxa studies that include bats. We provide recommendations for good modelling practices through considering spatial scale and spatial biases, selecting ecologically relevant variables, following rigorous modelling protocols, and recognising the limitations of extrapolation across temporal scales. We suggest future developments that will further favour the use of SDMs to study bat ecology and biogeography, as well as inform conservation management. We conclude that despite an increase in bat SDM studies, their scope and application can be further enhanced through incorporating dispersal, landscape connectivity and biotic interactions between bats, their prey and their pathogens.

Effects of climate change on bird-parasite interactions	ECOSISTEMAS				Article								During the last years, models on the effects of climate change predict the arrival of milder climates to higher latitudes and altitudes. and as a consequence, the spread of disease from lower latitudes and altitudes. Bird-parasite interactions are not an exception and could be affected by these changes. However. several reviews on the effects of climate change on birds and parasites conclude that effects of climate on these interactions could be diverse and complex and, in general, difficult to predict. In this article we review some studies reporting climatic effects on bird-parasite relationships, showing different aspects that may interact in these cases. Biodiversity, density of organisms. both of hosts or parasites, virulence of parasites and host immunocompetence, are key factors to understand the effects of climate change on bird-parasite interactions. More empirical work is clearly needed to show the level of impact of climate change on birds and parasite populations as well as on their capacity of adaptation to those changes.

Vector range expansion and anthropogenic factors such as habitat encroachment and climate change are altering viral evolutionary dynamics and exposure. However, little is known about the diversity of viruses present in these populations. Small felid populations with lower genetic diversity are likely to be most threatened with extinction by emerging diseases, as with other selective pressures, due to having less adaptive potential. We used a metagenomic approach to identify novel circoviruses, which may have a negative impact on the population viability, from confirmed bobcat (Lynx rufus) and puma (Puma concolor) scats collected in Sonora, Mexico. Given some circoviruses are known to cause disease in their hosts, such as porcine and avian circoviruses, we took a non-invasive approach using scat to identify circoviruses in free-roaming bobcats and puma. Three circovirus genomes were determined, and, based on the current species demarcation, they represent two novel species. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that one circovirus species is more closely related to rodent associated circoviruses and the other to bat associated circoviruses, sharing highest genome-wide pairwise identity of approximately 70% and 63%, respectively. At this time, it is unknown whether these scat-derived circoviruses infect felids, their prey, or another organism that might have had contact with the scat in the environment. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the host of these viruses and assess health impacts in felids.

Heat tolerance variation reveals vulnerability of tropical herbivore-parasitoid interactions to climate change	ECOLOGY LETTERS				Article								Assessing the heat tolerance (CTmax) of organisms is central to understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity. While both environment and evolutionary history affect CTmax, it remains unclear how these factors and their interplay influence ecological interactions, communities and ecosystems under climate change. We collected and reared caterpillars and parasitoids from canopy and ground layers in different seasons in a tropical rainforest. We tested the CTmax and Thermal Safety Margins (TSM) of these food webs with implications for how species interactions could shift under climate change. We identified strong influence of phylogeny in herbivore-parasitoid community heat tolerance. The TSM of all insects were narrower in the canopy and parasitoids had lower heat tolerance compared to their hosts. Our CTmax-based simulation showed higher herbivore-parasitoid food web instability under climate change than previously assumed, highlighting the vulnerability of parasitoids and related herbivore control in tropical rainforests, particularly in the forest canopy.

J	Mitchell, CE; Tilman, D; Groth, JV				Mitchell, CE; Tilman, D; Groth, JV			Effects of grassland plant species diversity, abundance, and composition on foliar fungal disease	ECOLOGY				Article								In an experiment that directly. manipulated grassland plant species richness and composition, decreased plant species richness ("diversity") increased pathogen load (the percentage of leaf area infected by species-specific foliar pathogens across the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance. These results suggest that increased abundances of individual host species at lower species diversity increased disease transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of diversity on disease was highly significant, considerable variance in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level. Much of this residual variance was explained by community characteristics that were a function of the species composition of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those lost). Specifically, communities that lost less disease-prone species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak. Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined more by regional than local processes, because it was better correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations across the region than with local abundance or frequency across the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics determined by species composition will strongly influence pathogen load.

Climate change compounded with trends of rural abandonment are likely to diminish forested areas within the Mediterranean basin that will be replaced by fire prone shrub communities. This could be favoured by outbreaks of pathogens, fire and other large-scale disturbances. Landscape fragmentation is expected to impede species migration. Annual increments and subsequent income from forests are expected to decrease. Reafforestations are necessary to ensure the presence of propagules of forest species and their site-specific varieties best adapted to future climatic conditions even though they may be different from the present forest-plant community. Current challenges in biodiversity conservation can only be met by afforestations whose main objective is to maintain ecosystem functioning. A new silviculture must emerge encompassing these habitat displacement and economic concerns while maximizing carbon sequestration.

Fossil pigments and ancient DNA present in various sedimentary deposits can be analysed to study long-term changes in ecological communities. We analysed recent compilations of data, including fossil pigments, microfossils, and molecular inventories from the sedimentary archives, to understand the impact of gradual versus abrupt climate changes on the ecosystem status of a regional model lake over the last similar to 14.5 kyr. Such long and complete paleo-archives are scarce in North-Eastern Europe. The study site lies in a sensitive area, both climatically and in respect to vegetation. Namely the maritime-continentality line runs west to east in the central Baltic area to NE Europe and its south-north transect lies within the gradual decay of the nemoral forest into a boreal environment. Therefore, the selected location is an ideal sampling point to decipher long term environmental changes in the temperate climate zone. The main objective of the present study was to find out external factors influencing phototroph dynamics at temperate Lake Lielais Svetinu over the post-glacial period (similar to 14.5 kyr). We were able to model climate change together with vegetation change and the appearance of anthropogenic forcing, either as a gradual change or as abrupt events that influenced the phototrophs, which are keystone groups within the lacustrine ecosystem. Most interestingly, the gradual increase of species richness of phototrophs was linked to similar increase in fungal parasites of the same group - phototrophs. Abrupt climate change in the Late Glacial period caused abrupt events in the ecosystem but equally abrupt events were caused by gradual changes during the stable period of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). In addition, we highlight the increased frequency and degree of perturbation in pristine lakes due to low impact human activity over a larger region. Both observations demonstrate an impaired relationship between gradual external drivers and ecosystem response and apply to future scenarios of climate warming and increased human impact in north-eastern Europe.

Range-wide conservation of Pinus aristata: a genetic collection with ecological context for proactive management today and resources for tomorrow	NEW FORESTS				Article								Tree species are highly vulnerable to anthropogenic environmental change, and are increasingly being challenged by non-native pests and climate change. Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines are long-lived, exhibit delayed maturation, have low genetic diversity, and inhabit cold, high-elevation environments. They are threatened by the non-native disease white pine blister rust, warming temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and altered disturbance regimes. The goal of this work was to (1) sample the range-wide genetic diversity of bristlecone pine for ex situ seed and tissue collections and research before the populations are impacted, (2) assess the health and ecological conditions of the species across its geographic range (61 stands) to provide a baseline by which to evaluate future changes, and (3) assess relationships between stand and regeneration characteristics and topographic, geographic, and climatic factors to identify vulnerabilities and proactive management interventions to increase population resilience. Local variation in topoclimate was strongly related to stand structure, composition, health, and regeneration. Bristlecone pine currently showed only minor impacts from insects and pathogens, but relationships between cone production and regeneration with climate variables suggest vulnerabilities to projected climate change. Both cone production and seedling regeneration were also linked to stand structure and ground cover that provide opportunities for proactive in situ management to increase population size to mitigate potential future climate- and pathogen-driven declines. These efforts represent the first proactive coordinated range-wide genetic collection design and forest health assessment for a threatened, but not yet impacted, tree species and offers a model for other species at risk.

Infectious disease emergence and human response	ANIMAL HEALTH RESEARCH REVIEWS				Review								The global political economy is facing extreme challenges against a backdrop of large-scale expansion of human and domestic animal populations and related impacts on the biosphere. Significant global socio-ecological changes have occurred in the period of a single lifetime, driven by increased technology and access to physical and biological resources through open markets and globalization. Current resource consumption rates are not sustainable and ecological tipping points are being reached and one of the indicators of these may be a changing balance between hosts and pathogens. A period of extraordinary progress in reducing infection risk and disease impact on humans and domestic animals in the 20th Century is reversing in the 21st, but not always and not everywhere. Drivers for this shift are discussed in terms of demographics, agroecology, biodiversity decline and loss of resilience in ecosystems, climate change and increasing interconnectedness between species globally. Causality of disease emergence remains highly speculative, but patterns and data are emerging to commend a precautionary approach, while reassessing our global political, social and economic systems.

Climate Change and Shell-Boring Polychaetes (Annelida: Spionidae): Current State of Knowledge and the Need for More Experimental Research	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN				Article								Anthropogenic climate change is considered to be one of the greatest threats facing marine biodiversity. The vast majority of experimental work investigating the effects of climate change stressors on marine organisms has focused on calcifying organisms, such as corals and molluscs, where cross-generational phenotypic changes can be easily quantified. Bivalves in particular have been the subject of numerous climate change studies, in part because of their economic value in the aquaculture industry and their important roles as ecosystem engineers. However, there has been little to no work investigating the effects of these stressors on the symbionts associated with these bivalves, specifically, their shell-boring polychaete parasites. This is important to understand because climate change may shift the synergistic relationship between parasite and host based on the individual responses of each. If such a shift favors proliferation of the polychaete, it may very well facilitate extinction of host bivalve populations. In this review I will (i) provide an overview of research completed thus far on the effects of climate change stressors on shell-boring polychaetes, (ii) discuss the technical challenges of studying these parasites in the laboratory, and (iii) propose a standardized framework for carrying out future in vitro and in vivo climate change experiments on shell-boring polychaetes.

Low MHC variation in the polar bear: implications in the face of Arctic warming?	ANIMAL CONSERVATION				Article								Animals in the Arctic have low pathogen diversity but with rapid climate warming, this is expected to change. One insidious consequence of climate change is exposure of Arctic species to new pathogens derived from more southern species expanding their range northward. To assess potential vulnerability of polar bears to disease exposure, we examined genetic variation in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci (part of immune system) in Canadian polar bears and found low genetic diversity, consistent with long-standing exposure to low pathogen/parasite loads. All polar bears surveyed showed maximum linkage disequilibrium between DRB/DQB loci and 12% of individuals had a duplicated DQB gene haplotype. These results may reflect balancing selection at these loci, a response to an earlier immune-challenge and/or be artifacts of polar bear-brown bear divergence. Consistent with the latter, we found one DQA allele in polar bears that was also a brown bear DQA allele. The reported low MHC diversity and high linkage disequilibrium may have serious implications for polar bear resistance to new pathogens, which would be maladaptive to species in an environment undergoing rapid climate change, such as the Arctic.

Insights from modeling studies on how climate change affects invasive alien species geography	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Article								Climate change and biological invasions are threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. It has now been widely acknowledged that climate change will affect biological invasions. A large number of studies have investigated predicted shifts and other changes in the geographic ranges of invasive alien species related to climate change using modeling approaches. Yet these studies have provided contradictory evidence, and no consensus has been reached. We conducted a systematic review of 423 modeling case studies included in 71 publications that have examined the predicted effects of climate change on those species. We differentiate the approaches used in these studies and synthesize their main results. Our results reaffirm the major role of climate change as a driver of invasive alien species distribution in the future. We found biases in the literature both regarding the taxa, toward plants and invertebrates, and the areas of the planet investigated. Despite these biases, we found for the plants and vertebrates studied that climate change will more frequently contribute to a decrease in species range size than an increase in the overall area occupied. This is largely due to oceans preventing terrestrial invaders from spreading poleward. In contrast, we found that the ranges of invertebrates and pathogens studied are more likely to increase following climate change. An important caveat to these findings is that researchers have rarely considered the effects of climate change on transport, introduction success, or the resulting impacts. We recommend closing these research gaps, and propose additional avenues for future investigations, as well as opportunities and challenges for managing invasions under climate change.

Patterns in the abundance and distribution of ichneumonid parasitoids within and across habitat patches	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				Review								1. Knowing how species are distributed across a landscape can considerably aid the management of populations and species richness. Insect parasitoids constitute a large fraction of terrestrial biodiversity and help regulate other insect populations, but their ecology is poorly known at a landscape scale. 2. Using Malaise traps distributed first extensively and then intensively across woodland patches in an agricultural landscape, we tested whether four ichneumonid subfamilies display (i) a positive relationship between abundance and occupancy, (ii) a positive relationship between abundance in the extensive sample and abundance in the intensive sample, and (iii) aggregation across traps. 3. A positive relationship between abundance and occupancy was found across species in both samples, and was relatively strong. Abundance in the extensive samples was positively correlated with abundance in the intensive samples. On average, species were aggregated in both samples, although aggregation was not necessary for a positive abundance-occupancy relationship. 4. These results suggest that ichneumonid species can largely be classified oil a continuum from widespread and locally abundant to localised and locally scarce. The former species allow the potential for pervasive natural control of host populations. The latter species, which constitute a substantial majority of the species list, will be vulnerable to extinction through both stochastic forces and widespread adverse forces such as climate change and habitat modification. However, the assessment of species' status is likely to be facilitated by the positive abundance-occupancy relationship. 5. Species inventories for ichneumonids will be taxing because of the need to sample both intensively and extensively to detect rare species, which constitute the majority of species. However, it is possible to generalise species abundances across spatial scales and years, facilitating monitoring.	[Fraser, Sally E.

Parasite transmission in complex communities: Predators and alternative hosts alter pathogenic infections in amphibians	ECOLOGY				Article								While often studied in isolation, host-parasite interactions are typically embedded within complex communities. Other community members, including predators and alternative hosts, can therefore alter parasite transmission (e.g., the dilution effect), yet few studies have experimentally evaluated more than one such mechanism. Here, we used data from natural wetlands to design experiments investigating how alternative hosts and predators of parasites mediate trematode (Ribeiroia ondatrae) infection in a focal amphibian host (Pseudacris regilla). In short-term predation bioassays involving mollusks, zooplankton, fish, larval insects, or newts, four of seven tested species removed 62-93% of infectious stages. In transmission experiments, damselfly nymphs (predators) and newt larvae (alternative hosts) reduced infection in P. regilla tadpoles by similar to 50%, whereas mosquitofish (potential predators and alternative hosts) did not significantly influence transmission. Additional bioassays indicated that predators consumed parasites even in the presence of alternative prey. In natural wetlands, newts had similar infection intensities as P. regilla, suggesting that they commonly function as alternative hosts despite their unpalatability to downstream hosts, whereas mosquitofish had substantially lower infection intensities and are unlikely to function as hosts. These results underscore the importance of studying host-parasite interactions in complex communities and of broadly linking research on predation, biodiversity loss, and infectious diseases.

Preliminary evidence suggests that climate change and human movements and commerce may have played a role in recent range expansions of avian pathogens. Since the magnitude of climate change in the coming decades is predicted to exceed climatic changes in the recent past, there is an urgent need to determine the extent to which climate change may drive the spread of disease by avian migrants. In this review, we recommend actions intended to mitigate the impact of emergent pathogens of migratory birds on biodiversity and public health. Increased surveillance that builds upon existing bird banding networks is required to conclusively establish a link between climate and avian pathogens and to prevent pathogens with migratory bird reservoirs from spilling over to humans.

Climate change effects on aquatic biota, ecosystem structure and function	AMBIO				Review								Climate change is projected to cause significant alterations to aquatic biogeochemical processes, (including carbon dynamics), aquatic food web structure, dynamics and biodiversity, primary and secondary production; and, affect the range, distribution and habitat quality/quantity of aquatic mammals and waterfowl. Projected enhanced permafrost thawing is very likely to increase nutrient, sediment, and carbon loadings to aquatic systems, resulting in both positive and negative effects on freshwater chemistry. Nutrient and carbon enrichment will enhance nutrient cycling and productivity, and alter the generation and consumption of carbon-based trace gases. Consequently, the status of aquatic ecosystems as carbon sinks or sources is very likely to change. Climate change will also very likely affect the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems across most of the Arctic. The magnitude, extent, and duration of the impacts and responses will be system- and location-dependent. Projected effects on aquatic mammals and waterfowl include altered migration routes and timing; a possible increase in the incidence of mortality and decreased growth and productivity from disease and/or parasites; and, probable changes in habitat suitability and timing of availability.

Assessing five decades of change in a high Arctic parasitoid community	ECOGRAPHY				Article								Arctic ecosystems are fragile, and are particularly sensitive to the pressures of climate change. Both average temperature and precipitation have increased over the past five decades on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada in the high Arctic. Altered growth forms and increased biomass in dominant plant species on Ellesmere Island have been observed concurrent with the changing climate, but shifts in the diversity or rank abundance of plant and bird species have not been detected. Changes in diversity may take longer to appear, or may be assessed better using organisms with shorter generation times such as insects. We explored the ecological impacts of climate change on Ellesmere Island using historical and contemporary communities of ichneumonid wasps. We compared community diversity, functional composition, and body size of two common species using ichneumonid specimens collected in 1961-1965, 1980-1982, 1989-1992, and 2010. We found high compositional similarity between collections, overlapping estimates of species richness, no change in the proportion of idiobiont genera in the community, and no clear pattern in body size over time. The greatest amount of variation over time was detected in parasitoids of herbivores; proportionally fewer herbivore-parasitizing genera were found in 2010 than in historical collections, and the two genera that were only found in one of the four collections were both parasitoids of herbivores. Our results point to the need to assess climate change effects in Arctic systems using a range of taxa, and responses to large-scale environmental disturbances may be idiosyncratic and difficult to predict.

J	McDonald, BA				McDonald, B. A.			How can research on pathogen population biology suggest disease management strategies? The example of barley scald (Rhynchosporium commune)	PLANT PATHOLOGY				Review								Barley scald fungus, Rhynchosporium commune, belongs to a host-specialized species complex infecting grasses. Coalescent analyses of several genes indicate that R. commune originated c. 2500 years ago, after the domestication of barley. Phylogeographical analyses identified a diversity hotspot in Scandinavia, indicating an origin in northern Europe. After its emergence, R. commune became distributed globally on infected seeds, eventually invading the Fertile Crescent and infecting wild barley progenitors. Analyses of gene flow identified historical routes of migration out of Scandinavia and indicate a high degree of modern gene flow among South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. About 76% of global species diversity is found within barley fields, with all field populations showing a genetic structure consistent with sexual recombination. High levels of regional gene flow suggest wind-dispersed ascospores and movement of infected seed. Quantitative traits, including pathogen aggressiveness, thermal sensitivity and fungicide resistance, showed high heritability and high levels of diversity within nine globally representative populations. Field experiments provided evidence for a fitness cost associated with complex virulence and a trade-off between pathogenic and saprophytic fitness. All findings indicate that global R. commune populations have significant potential to evolve rapidly in response to environmental changes, including deployment of resistant cultivars, fungicide applications and global warming. Specific recommendations to improve management of barley scald include: (i) focus resistance breeding efforts in northern Europe, which offers the best location to screen germplasm and may provide useful sources of scald resistance; (ii) improve seed treatment, certification and quarantine programmes to limit long distance pathogen movement; (iii) manage barley stubble to decrease pathogen population size, limit production of sexual inoculum and reduce the pathogen's evolutionary potential.

Climate Change and Defense against Pathogens in Plants	ADVANCES IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY, VOL 81	Advances in Applied Microbiology			Review; Book Chapter								Most reviews of climate change are epidemiological, focusing on impact assessment and risk mapping. However, there are many reports of the effects of environmental stress factors on defense mechanisms in plants against pathogens. We review those representative of key climate change-related stresses to determine whether there are any patterns or trends in adaptation responses. We recognize the complexity of climate change itself and the multitrophic nature of the complex biological interactions of plants, microbes, soil, and the environment and, therefore, the difficulty of reductionist dissection approaches to resolving the problems. We review host defense genes, germplasm, and environmental interactions in different types of organisms but find no significant group-specific trends. Similarly, we review by host defense mechanism type and by host pathogen trophic relationship but identify no dominating mechanism for stress response. However, we do identify core stress response mechanisms playing key roles in multiple response pathways whether to biotic or abiotic stress. We suggest that these should be central to mechanistic climate change plant defense research. We also recognize biodiversity, heterogeneity, and the need for understanding stress in a true systems biology approach as being essential components of progressing our understanding of and response to climate change.

The present one-dimensional physical and chemical production systems should be replaced by an agricultural paradigm that rely more on biology, ecology and sociology, and meet global food needs based on the soil, water, land and fertility resources without compromising the capacity of future generations in meeting their environmental, food and resource needs. Organic agriculture as an alternative to conventional systems of food production should contain features of agricultural systems that promote the environmentally, socially and economically sound production of food and fibre, and aim to optimize quality at all levels. The underlying principles are to minimize the use of external inputs as far as possible and use of resources and practices that enhance the balance of ecosystems and integrate components of farming systems into an ecological system. Organic agriculture is developing rapidly and the organic land area is increased by almost 1.8 million hectares compared to the consolidated data from 2005. Worldwide, in 2006, over 30.4 million hectares were managed organically by more than 700000 farms, constituting 0.65 percent of the agricultural land of the countries surveyed. Recognizing the ecological principles, self-regulating ability and system stability, agro-biodiversity, climate change and global warming soil nutrients and soil biology, erosion, nonchemical crop protection and generally agroecosystem health are the most significant ecological and environmental issues regarding production systems. Organic agriculture in farming, processing distribution or consumption is to sustain and enhance the process of food safety and health at all stages and levels of the agroecosystem in order to prevent serious food safety hazards such as pathogens like prions (BSE), allergens, mycotoxins, dioxins, GMOs, pesticide residues, growth hormones, food additives like colorants, preservatives, flavours, process aids, nitrite added to processed meat, salt, added sugar and saturated fat. There are growing evidences suggesting that organic agricultural systems produce enough quantity and quality foods and have a number of ecological, environmental and health advantages for consumers over food from conventional systems.

The conservation of bees: a global perspective	APIDOLOGIE				Review								Bees are major pollinators of Angiosperms and therefore their apparent decline is of importance for humans and biodiversity. We synthesise results of 12 recent reviews to provide a global picture of the threats they face. Habitat loss is the major threat to bee diversity, whilst invasive species, emerging diseases, pesticide use, and climate change also have the potential to impact bee populations. We suggest that future conservation strategies need to prioritise (i) minimising habitat loss, (ii) making agricultural habitats bee-friendly, (iii) training scientists and the public in bee taxonomy and identification, (iv) basic autecological and population genetic studies to underpin conservation strategies, (v) assessing the value of DNA barcoding for bee conservation, (vi) determining the impact of invasive plants, animals, parasites and pathogens, and (vii) integrating this information to understand the potential impact of climate change on current bee diversity.

Reconstructing the emergence of a lethal infectious disease of wildlife supports a key role for spread through translocations by humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								There have been few reconstructions of wildlife disease emergences, despite their extensive impact on biodiversity and human health. This is in large part attributable to the lack of structured and robust spatio-temporal datasets. We overcame logistical problems of obtaining suitable information by using data from a citizen science project and formulating spatio-temporal models of the spread of a wildlife pathogen (genus Ranavirus, infecting amphibians). We evaluated three main hypotheses for the rapid increase in disease reports in the UK: that outbreaks were being reported more frequently, that climate change had altered the interaction between hosts and a previously widespread pathogen, and that disease was emerging due to spatial spread of a novel pathogen. Our analysis characterized localized spread from nearby ponds, consistent with amphibian dispersal, but also revealed a highly significant trend for elevated rates of additional outbreaks in localities with higher human population density-pointing to human activities in also spreading the virus. Phylogenetic analyses of pathogen genomes support the inference of at least two independent introductions into the UK. Together these results point strongly to humans repeatedly translocating ranaviruses into the UK from other countries and between UK ponds, and therefore suggest potential control measures.

First Record of Fungal Diversity in the Tropical and Warm-Temperate Middle Miocene Climate Optimum Forests of Eurasia	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE				Article								The middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO) was the warmest interval of the last 23 million years and is one of the best analogs for proposed future climate change scenarios. Fungi play a key role in the terrestrial carbon cycle as dominant decomposers of plant debris, and through their interactions with plants and other organisms as symbionts, parasites, and endobionts. Thus, their study in the fossil record, especially during the MMCO, is essential to better understand biodiversity changes and terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics in past analogous environments, as well as to model future ecological and climatic scenarios. The fossil record also offers a unique long-term, large-scale dataset to evaluate fungal assemblage dynamics across long temporal and spatial scales, providing a better understanding of how ecological factors influenced assemblage development through time. In this study, we assessed the fungal diversity and community composition recorded in two geological sections from the middle Miocene from the coal mines of Thailand and Slovakia. We used presence-absence data to quantify the fungal diversity of each locality. Spores and other fungal remains were identified to modern taxa whenever possible; laboratory codes and fossil names were used when this correlation was not possible. This study represents the first of its kind for Thailand, and it expands existing work from Slovakia. Our results indicate a total of 281 morphotaxa. This work will allow us to use modern ecological data to make inferences about ecosystem characteristics and community dynamics for the studied regions. It opens new horizons for the study of past fungal diversity based on modern fungal ecological analyses. It also sheds light on how global variations in fungal species richness and community composition were affected by different climatic conditions and under rapid increases of temperature in the past to make inferences for the near climatic future.

These imports are connected with a number of environmental problems. Increasing the grain legume production in Europe could be a promising alternative. The impacts of introducing grain legumes into existing European crop rotations are investigated in this article. The environmental impacts are evaluated by using the SALCA (Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment) life cycle assessment method and the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database. Four regions with potential for increasing their grain legume area were chosen for this study: Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), Barrois (France), Canton Vaud (Switzerland) and Castilla y Leon (Spain). In each of these regions, two crop rotations were defined: a typical cereal-based rotation without grain leaumes and an alternative rotation including grain legumes. The production data were collected by the local project partners from statistics, surveys, literature, documents from extension services and using expert knowledge. The impacts of these two crop rotations were compared relative to three functional units representing different functions of agriculture: hectare per year as a measure of the land management function, E gross margin 1 for the financial function and GJ gross energy of the harvested biomass for the productive function. The following environmental impacts were analysed: demand for non-renewable energy resources, global warming potential, ozone formation, eutrophication, acidification, terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicity as well as human toxicity. For Canton Vaud, the impacts on biodiversity and soil quality were assessed in addition. Analysed per unit of cultivated area, the introduction of grain legumes into intensive crop rotations with a high proportion of cereals and intensive N-fertilisation leads to a reduced energy use, global warming potential, ozone formation and acidification as well as eco- and human toxicity. The main reasons for this are a reduced application of N-fertilisers (no N to the grain legume and less N to the following crop), improved possibilities for using reduced tillage techniques and greater diversification of the crop rotation, which helps to reduce problems caused by weeds and pathogens (and therefore pesticide applications). The nitrate leaching potential tends to be higher in general, but can be reduced by including catch crops or early sowing of winter grain legumes, where possible. No differences were found for the impacts of crop management on soil quality and biodiversity (studied in Canton Vaud only). In the low-input crop rotation in Spain, the introduction of peas had no favourable environmental effect, mainly because little or no N-fertiliser can be saved. The analysis per sic gross margin 1 (financial function) leads to slightly more favourable results for the grain legume crop rotations compared to the analysis per ha and year. Due to the lower yields of grain legumes compared with cereals, the advantages of grain legumes are smaller when considered per GJ gross energy of the harvested products (productive function). However, the energy efficiency is higher in crop rotations with grain legumes. On the whole, introducing grain legumes into European crop rotations offers interesting options for reducing environmental burdens, especially in a context of depleted fossil energy resources and climate change.

Avian malaria in New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL				Review								Avian malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium have the ability to cause morbidity and mortality in naive hosts, and their impact on the native biodiversity is potentially serious. Over the last decade, avian malaria has aroused increasing interest as an emerging disease in New Zealand with some endemic avian species, such as the endangered mohua (Mohua ochrocephala), thought to be particularly susceptible. To date, avian malaria parasites have been found in 35 different bird species in New Zealand and have been diagnosed as causing death in threatened species such as dotterel (Charadrius obscurus), South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus carunculatus), mohua, hihi (Notiomystis cincta) and two species of kiwi (Apteryx spp.). Introduced blackbirds (Turdus merula) have been found to be carriers of at least three strains of Plasmodium spp. and because they are very commonly infected, they are likely sources of infection for many of New Zealand's endemic birds. The spread and abundance of introduced and endemic mosquitoes as the result of climate change is also likely to be an important factor in the high prevalence of infection in some regions and at certain times of the year. Although still limited, there is a growing understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of Plasmodium spp. in New Zealand. Molecular biology has played an important part in this process and has markedly improved our understanding of the taxonomy of the genus Plasmodium. This review presents our current state of knowledge, discusses the possible infection and disease outcomes, the implications for host behaviour and reproduction, methods of diagnosis of infection, and the possible vectors for transmission of the disease in New Zealand.

J	da Silva, GG; Poulin, R; Guillermo-Ferreira, R				da Silva, Guilherme Gonzaga; Poulin, Robert; Guillermo-Ferreira, Rhainer			Do latitudinal and bioclimatic gradients drive parasitism in Odonata?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				Article								Prevalence of parasites in wild animals may follow ecogeographic patterns, under the influence of climatic factors and macroecological features. One of the largest scale biological patterns on Earth is the latitudinal diversity gradient; however, latitudinal gradients may also exist regarding the frequency of interspecific interactions such as the prevalence of parasitism in host populations. Dragonflies and damselflies (order Odonata) are hosts of a wide range of ecto- and endoparasites, interactions that can be affected by environmental factors that shape their occurrence and distribution, such as climatic variation, ultraviolet radiation and vegetation structure. Here, we retrieved data from the literature on parasites of Odonata, represented by 90 populations infected by ectoparasites (water mites) and 117 populations infected by endoparasites (intestinal gregarines). To test whether there is a latitudinal and bioclimatic gradient in the prevalence of water mites and gregarines parasitizing Odonata, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic comparative models. We found that prevalence of ectoparasites was partially associated with latitude, showing the opposite pattern from our expectations ? prevalence was reduced at lower latitudes. Prevalence of endoparasites was not affected by latitude. While prevalence of water mites was also positively associated with vegetation biomass and climatic stability, we found no evidence of the effect of bioclimatic variables on the prevalence of gregarines. Our study suggests that infection by ectoparasites of dragonflies and damselflies is driven by latitudinal and bioclimatic variables. We add evidence of the role of global-scale biological patterns in shaping biodiversity, suggesting that parasitic organisms may prove reliable sources of information about climate change and its impact on ecological interactions. ? 2021 Australian Society for Parasitology.

J	Cumming, GS; Van Vuuren, DP				Cumming, Graeme S.; Van Vuuren, Detlef P.			Will climate change affect ectoparasite species ranges?	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY				Article								Aim Over the next 100 years, human-driven climate change and resulting changes in species occurrences will have global impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human health. Here we examine how climate change may affect the occurrences of tick species in Africa and alter the suitability of habitat outside Africa for African ticks. Location Africa and the world. Methods We predicted continental and global changes in habitat suitability for each of 73 African tick species, using multiple regression models in different climate change scenarios that cover a wide range of uncertainty. Results Global habitat suitability improves for nearly all tick species under each of a representative range of eight climate change scenarios. Depending on the scenario, African tick species experience an average increase in global habitat suitability of between 1 million and 9 million square kilometres between 1990 and 2100. Main conclusions The potential for successful translocations of ticks and their pathogens from Africa to the rest of the world is likely to increase over the next 100 years. Although the general trend is one of range expansion, there are winners and losers among tick species in each scenario, suggesting that tick community composition will be disrupted substantially by climate change. If this is also typical of other invertebrates, then climate change will disrupt not only the geographic location of communities but also their structure. Changes in tick communities are also likely to influence tick-borne pathogens.

Confronting inconsistencies in the amphibian-chytridiomycosis system: implications for disease management	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				Review								Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is one of the largest threats to wildlife and is putatively linked to the extirpation of numerous amphibians. Despite over a decade of research on Bd, conflicting results from a number of studies make it difficult to forecast where future epizootics will occur and how to manage this pathogen effectively. Here, we emphasize how resolving these conflicts will advance Bd management and amphibian conservation efforts. We synthesize current knowledge on whether Bd is novel or endemic, whether amphibians exhibit acquired resistance to Bd, the importance of host resistance versus tolerance to Bd, and how biotic (e.g. species richness) and abiotic factors (e.g. climate change) affect Bd abundance. Advances in our knowledge of amphibian-chytrid interactions might inform the management of fungal pathogens in general, which are becoming more common and problematic globally.

Diversity of Endosymbiotic Nostoc in Gunnera magellanica (L) from Tierra del Fuego, Chile	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				Article								Global warming is causing ice retreat in glaciers worldwide, most visibly over the last few decades in some areas of the planet. One of the most affected areas is the region of Tierra del Fuego (southern South America). Vascular plant recolonisation of recently deglaciated areas in this region is initiated by Gunnera magellanica, which forms symbiotic associations with the cyanobacterial genus Nostoc, a trait that likely confers advantages in this colonisation process. This symbiotic association in the genus Gunnera is notable as it represents the only known symbiotic relationship between angiosperms and cyanobacteria. The aim of this work was to study the genetic diversity of the Nostoc symbionts in Gunnera at three different, nested scale levels: specimen, population and region. Three different genomic regions were examined in the study: a fragment of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S), the RuBisCO large subunit gene coupled with its promoter sequence and a chaperon-like protein (rbcLX) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The identity of Nostoc as the symbiont was confirmed in all the infected rhizome tissue analysed. Strains isolated in the present study were closely related to strains known to form symbioses with other organisms, such as lichen-forming fungi or bryophytes. We found 12 unique haplotypes in the 16S rRNA (small subunit) region analysis, 19 unique haplotypes in the ITS region analysis and 57 in the RuBisCO proteins region (rbcLX). No genetic variability was found among Nostoc symbionts within a single host plant while Nostoc populations among different host plants within a given sampling site revealed major differences. Noteworthy, interpopulation variation was also shown between recently deglaciated soils and more ancient ones, between eastern and western sites and between northern and southern slopes of Cordillera Darwin. The cell structure of the symbiotic relationship was observed with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy, showing changes in morphology of both cyanobiont cells (differentiate more heterocysts) and plant cells (increased size). Developmental stages of the symbiosis, including cell walls and membranes and EPS matrix states, were also observed.	[Fernandez-Martinez, M.

Examining the Impacts of CO2 Concentration and Genetic Compatibility on Perennial Ryegrass-Epichloe festucae var lolii Interactions	JOURNAL OF FUNGI				Article								Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is the most cultivated cool-season grass worldwide with crucial roles in carbon fixation, turfgrass applications, and fodder for livestock. Lolium perenne forms a mutualism with the strictly vertically transmitted fungal endophyte, Epichloe festucae var lolii. The fungus produces alkaloids that protect the grass from herbivory, as well as conferring protection from drought and nutrient stress. The rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, a proximate cause of climatic change, is known to have many direct and indirect effects on plant growth. There is keen interest in how the nature of this plant-fungal interaction will change with climate change. Lolium perenne is an obligately outcrossing species, meaning that the genetic profile of the host is constantly being reshuffled. Meanwhile, the fungus is asexual implying both a relatively constant genetic profile and the potential for incompatible grass-fungus pairings. In this study, we used a single cultivar, "Alto", of L. perenne. Each plant was infected with one of four strains of the endophyte: AR1, AR37, NEA2, and Lp19 (the "common strain"). We outcrossed the Alto mothers with pollen from a number of individuals from different ryegrass cultivars to create more genetic diversity in the hosts. We collected seed such that we had replicate maternal half-sib families. Seed from each family was randomly allocated into the two levels of the CO2 treatment, 400 and 800 ppm. Elevated CO2 resulted in an c. 18% increase in plant biomass. AR37 produced higher fungal concentrations than other strains; NEA2 produced the lowest fungal concentrations. We did not find evidence of genetic incompatibility between the host plants and the fungal strains. We conducted untargeted metabolomics and quantitative proteomics to investigate the grass-fungus interactions between and within family and treatment groups. We identified a number of changes in both the proteome and metabalome. Taken together, our data set provides new understanding into the intricacy of the interaction between endophyte and host from multiple molecular levels and suggests opportunity to promote plant robustness and survivability in rising CO2 environmental conditions through application of bioprotective epichloid strains.

Fungi constitute an important component of soil microorganism communities. They play an important role in biodiversity maintenance, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning, and differ from many macroorganisms in many traits. Here, we examined soil fungal communities in Chinese temperate, subtropical, and tropic forests using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region. The relative effect of late Quaternary climate change and contemporary environment (plant, soil, current climate, and geographic distance) on the soil fungal community was analyzed. The richness of the total fungal community, along with saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal (EM), and pathogenic fungal communities, was influenced primarily by the contemporary environment (plant and/or soil) but not by late Quaternary climate change. Late Quaternary climate change acted in concert with the contemporary environment to shape total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal community compositions and with a stronger effect in temperate forest than in tropic-subtropical forest ecosystems. Some contemporary environmental factors influencing total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal communities in temperate and tropic-subtropical forests were different. We demonstrate that late Quaternary climate change can help to explain current soil fungal community composition and argue that climatic legacies can help to predict soil fungal responses to climate change.

Like many tree species, it is increasingly under threat from climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species and emergent pathogens. As knowledge of the genetic structure of natural populations of trees is vital for managing these threats, as well as an essential basis for selection of material for replanting and restocking, we analysed levels and patterns of genetic diversity in the species at a range of spatial scales using high-resolution microsatellite markers. Our findings indicate that hazel populations exhibit high levels of genetic diversity along with low levels of population differentiation, suggesting extensive gene flow. Fine-scale genetic structuring was observed in some of the woodlands studied, probably resulting from restricted dispersal of the heavy nuts produced by the species. This, coupled with higher levels of pollen-mediated gene flow, resulted in a weak but significant pattern of isolation by distance. These results suggest that replanting following potential loss of hazel populations may not necessarily require the use of material from the same locality and mirror findings in other broadleaved tree species from the same area.

This raises the possibility of managing for genetic variation directly relevant to specific threats, such as those due to climate change or emerging infectious disease. Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) face the threat of a transmissible cancer, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), that has decimated wild populations and led to intensive management efforts. Recent discoveries from genomic and modeling studies reveal how natural devil populations are responding to DFTD, and can inform management of both captive and wild devil populations. Notably, recent studies have documented genetic variation for disease-related traits and rapid evolution in response to DFTD, as well as potential mechanisms for disease resistance such as immune response and tumor regression in wild devils. Recent models predict dynamic persistence of devils with or without DFTD under a variety of modeling scenarios, although at much lower population densities than before DFTD emerged, contrary to previous predictions of extinction. As a result, current management that focuses on captive breeding and release for maintaining genome-wide genetic diversity or demographic supplementation of populations could have negative consequences. Translocations of captive devils into wild populations evolving with DFTD can cause outbreeding depression and/or increases in the force of infection and thereby the severity of the epidemic, and we argue that these risks outweigh any benefits of demographic supplementation in wild populations. We also argue that genetic variation at loci associated with DFTD should be monitored in both captive and wild populations, and that as our understanding of DFTD-related genetic variation improves, considering genetic management approaches to target this variation is warranted in developing conservation strategies for Tasmanian devils.

J	Johnson, PTJ; Paull, SH				Johnson, Pieter T. J.; Paull, Sara H.			The ecology and emergence of diseases in fresh waters	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				Review								P>1. Freshwater ecosystems, including ponds, lakes, streams and rivers, represent an interaction nexus between environmental change and a wide variety of infectious diseases, including human malaria, salmonid whirling disease, amphibian chytridiomycosis, crayfish plague and many others. However, few studies have explicitly examined patterns of disease in fresh waters and how they are changing over time. 2. Freshwater environments can function as transmission foci for pathogens because of (i) the importance of fresh water for organism survival, (ii) the aquatic life histories of many vectors and intermediate hosts, (iii) the concentrated aggregations of species - both freshwater and terrestrial - in and around freshwater habitats and (iv) the highly altered condition of freshwater ecosystems, which can affect species interactions and disease pathology. 3. To determine whether water-related diseases in wildlife are increasing, we used generalised additive models to quantitatively assess trends in the scientific literature (1970-2009) for major freshwater groups, including amphibians, molluscs, crayfishes, fishes, mammals, reptiles and birds. We further examined what types of pathogens were primarily responsible for observed patterns and whether recurrent groups or transmission modes could be identified. 4. After correcting for research effort and temporal autocorrelation, we find that reports of disease varied over time and across freshwater taxa, with significant increases in amphibians, fishes and crayfishes, a significant decrease in molluscs, and no significant change in freshwater reptiles, birds or mammals. The types and diversity of pathogens varied considerably among groups. Reports of infection in amphibians were dominated by helminths and a chytridiomycete, in crayfishes by viruses and fungi, in molluscs by digenetic trematodes, in birds, fishes and mammals by viruses, protists and helminths and in reptiles by helminths and bacteria. 5. These results provide some of the first quantitative evidence indicative of a long-term increase in disease-related research for freshwater taxa. Managing freshwater ecosystems to reduce or minimise human and wildlife disease risk - arguably one of the most significant ecosystem services - will require enhanced incorporation of ecological approaches alongside medical and veterinary tools.

The feasibility of developing a risk assessment for the impact of climate change on the emergence of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in livestock in Europe: a Review	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				Review								P>Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most widespread of all medically important arboviruses with ticks of the Hyalomma spp. serving as the main vectors. Infection of livestock by CCHFV serves as a route of exposure to humans, as a reservoir of disease and as a route of importation. This study discusses the pathways and data requirements for a qualitative risk assessment for the emergence of CCHFV in livestock in Europe. A risk map approach is proposed based on layers that include the potential routes of release (e.g. by migrating birds carrying infected ticks) together with the main components for exposure, namely the distributions of the tick vectors, the small vertebrate host reservoirs and the livestock. A layer on landscape fragmentation serves as a surrogate for proximity of livestock to the tick cycle. Although the impact of climate change on the emergence of CCHF is not clear, comparing the distribution of risk factors in each layer currently with those predicted in the 2080s with climate change can be used to speculate how potential high-risk areas may shift. According to the risk pathway, transstadial and/or transovarial transmission in the tick vector are crucial for CCHFV spread. Vector competence and tick vector switching, however, remain critical factors for CCHFV colonization of new regions in Europe. The species of migratory bird is also an important consideration in the release assessment with greater abundance and biodiversity of ground-dwelling birds in southern Europe than in northern Europe.

A novel copro-diagnostic molecular method for qualitative detection and identification of parasitic nematodes in amphibians and reptiles	PLOS ONE				Article								Anthropogenic disturbance via resource acquisition, habitat fragmentation and climate change, amongst other factors, has led to catastrophic global biodiversity losses and species extinctions at an accelerating rate. Amphibians are currently one of the worst affected classes with at least a third of species categorised as being threatened with extinction. At the same time, they are also critically important for many habitats and provide man with a powerful proxy for ecosystem health by acting as a bioindicator group. Whilst the causes of synchronised amphibian losses are varied recent research has begun to highlight a growing role that macroparasites are playing in amphibian declines. However, diagnosing parasite infection in the field can be problematic, principally relying on collection and euthanasia of hosts, followed by necropsy and morphological identification of parasites in situ. The current study developed a non-invasive PCR-based methodology for sensitive detection and identification of parasitic nematode DNA released in the faeces of infected amphibians as egg or tissue fragments (environmental DNA). A DNA extraction protocol optimised for liberation of DNA from resilient parasite eggs was developed alongside the design of a novel, nematode universal, degenerate primer pair, thus avoiding the difficulties of using species specific primers in situations where common parasite species are unknown. Used in conjunction this protocol and primer pair was tested on a wide range of faecal samples from captive and wild amphibians. The primers and protocol were validated and detected infections, including a Railletnema nematode infection in poison dart frogs from ZSL London Zoo and Mantella cowani frogs in the wild. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of our PCR-based protocol for detecting nematode infection in other hosts, such as the presence of pinworm (Aspiculuris) in two tortoise species and whipworm (Trichuris muris) in mice. Our environmental DNA approach mitigates problems associated with microscopic identification and can be applied to detect nematode parasitoses in wild and captive hosts for infection surveillance and maintenance of healthy populations.

Thousands of malaria parasite species exploit squamate reptiles, birds, and mammals as vertebrate hosts as well as dipteran vectors. Among these, avian malaria and related parasites have revealed an extensive genetic diversity as well as phenotypic diversity with varying virulence, host range, distribution-offering an amenable experimental system which has played a key role in understanding the ecology and evolution of human malaria parasites. Since its discovery in 1885, avian malaria contributed a great deal to the success of the U.S. antimalarial program during World War II. From modelling the links between climate change and health from a conservation and public health perspectives, avian malaria offered new opportunities and a relatively tractable system which were otherwise diluted by socio-economic, vector control and infra-structural changes in the human malaria context. In this review, I highlight the importance of avian malaria research in understanding the influence of climate change, land use and deforestation on disease dynamics, and how this helps to understand the ecology and evolution of the disease both from human and wildlife perspectives.

J	Ujvari, B; Belov, K				Ujvari, Beata; Belov, Katherine			Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Markers in Conservation Biology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				Review								Human impacts through habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species and climate change are increasing the number of species threatened with extinction. Decreases in population size simultaneously lead to reductions in genetic diversity, ultimately reducing the ability of populations to adapt to a changing environment. In this way, loss of genetic polymorphism is linked with extinction risk. Recent advances in sequencing technologies mean that obtaining measures of genetic diversity at functionally important genes is within reach for conservation programs. A key region of the genome that should be targeted for population genetic studies is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). MHC genes, found in all jawed vertebrates, are the most polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. They play key roles in immune function via immune-recognition and -surveillance and host-parasite interaction. Therefore, measuring levels of polymorphism at these genes can provide indirect measures of the immunological fitness of populations. The MHC has also been linked with mate-choice and pregnancy outcomes and has application for improving mating success in captive breeding programs. The recent discovery that genetic diversity at MHC genes may protect against the spread of contagious cancers provides an added impetus for managing and protecting MHC diversity in wild populations. Here we review the field and focus on the successful applications of MHC-typing for conservation management. We emphasize the importance of using MHC markers when planning and executing wildlife rescue and conservation programs but stress that this should not be done to the detriment of genome-wide diversity.

Introduction to the Symposium: Parasites and Pests in Motion: Biology, Biodiversity and Climate Change	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				Article								Although climate change can cause extreme alterations to ecosystems, only limited research has investigated how altered physical conditions (e.g., warming, extreme temperature events, sea level rise, ocean acidification, and altered precipitation) influence species interactions. In particular, the interplay between host and parasites in such a changing world is in need of study. Our objective in organizing this symposium was to bring together researchers working on a wide variety of natural enemies (parasites, pathogens, and pests), to exchange knowledge on how aspects of global climate change may alter the distribution and ecology of these organisms and their hosts. It is our intention that the symposium and the resulting articles will foster more accurate modeling of and predictions about the impacts of climate change on the biology and ecology of natural enemies and their hosts.

Scientists' warning of threats to mountains	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				Review								Mountains are an essential component of the global life-support system. They are characterized by a rugged, heterog-enous landscape with rapidly changing environmental conditions providing myriad ecological niches over relativelysmall spatial scales. Although montane species are well adapted to life at extremes, they are highly vulnerable to human derived ecosystem threats. Here we build on the manifesto'World Scientists' Warning to Humanity',issuedbythe Alliance of World Scientists, to outline the major threats to mountain ecosystems. We highlight climate change asthe greatest threat to mountain ecosystems, which are more impacted than their lowland counterparts. We further dis-cuss the cascade of"knock-on"effects of climate change such as increased UV radiation, altered hydrological cycles,and altered pollution profiles; highlighting the biological and socio-economic consequences. Finally, we presenthow intensified use of mountains leads to overexploitation and abstraction of water, driving changes in carbonstock, reducing biodiversity, and impacting ecosystem functioning. These perturbations can provide opportunitiesfor invasive species, parasites and pathogens to colonize these fragile habitats, driving further changes and losses ofmicro- and macro-biodiversity, as well further impacting ecosystem services. Ultimately, imbalances in the normalfunctioning of mountain ecosystems will lead to changes in vital biological, biochemical, and chemical processes, crit-ically reducing ecosystem health with widespread repercussions for animal and human wellbeing. Developing tools inspecies/habitat conservation and future restoration is therefore essential if we are to effectively mitigate against the declining health of mountains	[Schmeller, Dirk S.; Haver, Marilen; Le Roux, Gael; Loyau, Adeline; Sentenac, Hugo] Univ Toulouse, UPS, INPT, LEFE, Toulouse, France; [Urbach, Davnah] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Global Mt Biodivers Assessment, Bern, Switzerland; [Bates, Kieran] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, 11a Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England; [Bates, Kieran; Fisher, Matthew C.] Imperial Coll London, MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London W2 1PG, England; [Bates, Kieran] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England; [Catalan, Jordi] CREAF Campus UAB,Edifici C, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Catalan, Jordi] CSIC, Campus UAB, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Cogalniceanu, Dan] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Nat Sci & Agr Sci, Al Univ 1, Constanta 900470, Romania; [Friesen, Jan; Machate, Oliver] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Fuereder, Leopold; Sommaruga, Ruben] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Gaube, Veronika; Mayer, Andreas; Plutzar, Christoph] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Social Ecol SEC, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Schottenfeldgasse 29, Vienna, Austria; [Jacobsen, Dean] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Freshwater Biol Sect, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lin, Yu-Pin] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Palomo, Ignacio] Univ Grenoble Alpes, IGE, Grenoble INP, CNRS,IRD, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Tiberti, Rocco] Univ Pavia, Dept Earth & Environm Sci DSTA, Via Ferrata 9, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Ripple, William J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA		Schmeller, DS (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, INPT, LEFE, Toulouse, France.	ds@die-schmellers.de; davnah.payne@ips.unibe.ch; kieran.bates@zoo.ox.ac.uk; j.catalan@creaf.uab.cat; matthew.fisher@imperial.ac.uk; jan.friesen@ufz.de; Leopold.Fuereder@uibk.ac.at; veronika.gaube@boku.ac.at; marilen.haver@toulouse-inp.fr; djacobsen@bio.ku.dk; gael.leroux@toulouse-inp.fr; yplin@ntu.edu.tw; al@adeline-loyau.net; andreas.mayer@boku.ac.at; ignacio.palomo@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr; Christoph.Plutzar@umweltbundesamt.at; hugo.sentenac@toulouse-inp.fr; Ruben.Sommaruga@uibk.ac.at; rocco.tiberti@gmail.com; bill.ripple@oregonstate.edu								9	9											DEC 20	2022	853								158611	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158611		SEP 2022		Environmental Sciences				36087665				2023-09-28	WOS:000862777400006
J	Herath, J; Ellepola, G; Meegaskumbura, M				Herath, Jayampathi; Ellepola, Gajaba; Meegaskumbura, Madhava			Patterns of infection, origins, and transmission of ranaviruses among the ectothermic vertebrates of Asia	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Review								Ranaviral infections, a malady of ectothermic vertebrates, are becoming frequent, severe, and widespread, causing mortality among both wild and cultured species, raising odds of species extinctions and economic losses. This increase in infection is possibly due to the broad host range of ranaviruses and the transmission of these pathogens through regional and international trade in Asia, where outbreaks have been increasingly reported over the past decade. Here, we focus attention on the origins, means of transmission, and patterns of spread of this infection within the region. Infections have been recorded in both cultured and wild populations in at least nine countries/administrative regions, together with mass die-offs in some regions. Despite the imminent seriousness of the disease in Asia, surveillance efforts are still incipient. Some of the viral strains within Asia may transmit across host-taxon barriers, posing a significant risk to native species. Factors such as rising temperatures due to global climate change seem to exacerbate ranaviral activity, as most known outbreaks have been recorded during summer; however, data are still inadequate to verify this pattern for Asia. Import risk analysis, using protocols such as Pandora+, pre-border pathogen screening, and effective biosecurity measures, can be used to mitigate introduction of ranaviruses to uninfected areas and curb transmission within Asia. Comprehensive surveillance using molecular diagnostic tools for ranavirus species and variants will help in understanding the prevalence and disease burden in the region. This is an important step toward conserving native biodiversity and safeguarding the aquaculture industry.

Despite this, the mechanisms underlying disease emergence are still not fully understood, and control measures rely heavily on mitigating the impact of EIDs after they have emerged. Here, we highlight the emergence of a zoonotic Henipavirus, Nipah virus, to demonstrate the interdisciplinary and macroecological approaches necessary to understand EID emergence. Previous work suggests that Nipah virus emerged due to the interaction of the wildlife reservoir (Pteropus spp. fruit bats) with intensively Managed livestock. The emergence of this and other henipaviruses involves interactions among a suite of anthropogenic environmental changes, socioeconomic factors, and changes in demography that overlay and interact with the distribution of these pathogens in their wildlife reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate how ecological niche modeling may be used to investigate the potential role of a changing climate on the future risk for Henipavirus emergence. We show that the distribution of Henipavirus reservoirs, and therefore henipaviruses, will likely change under climate change scenarios, a fundamental precondition for disease emergence in humans. We assess the variation among climate models to estimate where Henipavirus host distribution is most likely to expand, contract, or remain stable, presenting new risks for human health. We conclude that there is substantial potential to use this modeling framework to explore the distribution of wildlife hosts under a changing climate. These approaches may directly inform current and future management and surveillance strategies aiming to improve pathogen detection and, ultimately, reduce emergence risk.

J	Scholz, T; Choudhury, A				Scholz, Tomas; Choudhury, Anindo			PARASITES OF FRESHWATER FISHES IN NORTH AMERICA: WHY SO NEGLECTED?	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY				Article								Fish parasitology has a long tradition in North America and numerous parasitologists have contributed considerably to the current knowledge of the diversity and biology of protistan and metazoan parasites of freshwater fishes. The Journal of Parasitology has been essential in disseminating this knowledge and remains a significant contributor to our understanding of fish parasites in North America as well as more broadly at the international level. However, with a few exceptions, the importance of fish parasites has decreased during the last decades, which is reflected in the considerable decline of funding and corresponding decrease of attention paid to these parasites in Canada and the United States of America. After the 'golden age' in the second half of the 20th Century, fish parasitology in Canada and the United States went in a new direction, driven by technology and a shift in priorities. In contrast, fish parasitology in Mexico has undergone rapid development since the early 1990s, partly due to extensive international collaboration and governmental funding. A critical review of the current data on the parasites of freshwater fishes in North America has revealed considerable gaps in the knowledge of their species composition, host specificity, life cycles, evolution, phylogeography, and relationships with their fish hosts. As to the key question, ''Why so neglected?'' this is probably because: (1) fish parasites are not in the forefront due to their lesser economic importance; (2) there is little funding for this kind of research, especially if a practical application is not immediately apparent; and (3) of shifting interests and a shortage of key personalities to train a new generation (they switched to marine habitats or other fields). Some of the opportunities for future research are outlined, such as climate change and cryptic species diversity. A significant problem challenging future research seems to be the loss of trained and experienced fish parasitologists. This has 2 major ramifications: the loss of expertise in identifying organisms that other biologists (e.g., ecologists, molecular biologists, evolutionists) work with, and an incomplete comprehension of ecosystem structure and function in the face of climate change, emerging diseases, and loss of biodiversity.

Fun(gi)omics: Advanced and Diverse Technologies to Explore Emerging Fungal Pathogens and Define Mechanisms of Antifungal Resistance	MBIO				Review								The landscape of infectious fungal agents includes previously unidenti-fied or rare pathogens with the potential to cause unprecedented casualties in biodiversity, food security, and human health. The influences of human activity, including the crisis of climate change, along with globalized transport, are underlying factors shaping fungal adaptation to increased temperature and expanded geographical regions. Furthermore, the emergence of novel antifungal-resistant strains linked to excessive use of antifungals (in the clinic) and fungicides (in the field) offers an additional challenge to protect major crop staples and control dangerous fungal outbreaks. Hence, the alarming frequency of fungal infections in medical and agricultural settings requires effective research to understand the virulent nature of fungal pathogens and improve the outcome of infection in susceptible hosts. Mycology-driven research has benefited from a contemporary and unified approach of omics technology, deepening the biological, biochemical, and biophysical understanding of these emerging fungal pathogens. Here, we review the current state-ofthe-art multi-omics technologies, explore the power of data integration strategies, and highlight discovery-based revelations of globally important and taxonomically diverse fungal pathogens. This information provides new insight for emerging pathogens through an in-depth understanding of well-characterized fungi and provides alternative therapeutic strategies defined through novel findings of virulence, adaptation, and resistance.

Despite the critical roles of the alternate host plants, the Berberis species, in the sexual reproduction and spread of Pst, the climate change impacts on the redistribution of Berberis plants, and their potential risk of incurring wheat stripe rust are scarcely discussed in the literature. This study evaluated the potential risk of Pst in wheat cultivation in Sichuan Province, China, for the first time, by analyzing the dynamics of Berberis plants and the change in Pst oversummering range under climate change scenarios. Ensembles of small models (ESMs) in combination with four algorithms were used to project the future (i.e., 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100) distributions of 54 Berberis species in Sichuan Province based on two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) scenarios. The species richness of Berberis was predicted to increase in northwestern Sichuan but decreased in southern and eastern Sichuan under both SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. The mean temperature of the driest quarter was found to be the determinant of the distributional shifts for the majority of Berberis plants. Our overlapping assessments indicated that the risk of wheat stripe rust would be reduced in southwestern Sichuan. In contrast, it would be aggravated in the northwest due to the predicted shifts of Berberis plants northwards and stronger shrinkage of Pst oversummering range occurring in the south than in the north. In the "hotspots" of the stripe rust pathogen, risk assessment in advance could provide a scientific basis for decision-makers and local communities in effectively controlling wheat stripe rust, thus further sustaining food security through adapting to future climate change.

Amphibians are the most threatened class of vertebrates. In addition to traditional threats such as land-use conversion and pollution, climate change and introduced diseases are expected to further reduce amphibian biodiversity. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis has caused the rapid extirpation of tens to possibly hundreds of amphibian species. Recent advances have revealed a deep evolutionary history and considerable variation in the virulence of strains of the fungal pathogen, patterns that need to be reconciled with the rapid spread of disease and demise of host populations. A conservation priority is surveillance of a newly discovered species of chytrid fungus that is killing European salamanders. The accelerated discovery of new amphibian species challenges existing conservation resources, but it is an opportunity to fill geographical gaps and to enhance programs aimed at preserving amphibian biodiversity.

Nevertheless, the CAP tries to take biodiversity into account via proposing a range of agri-environmental measures. These ES contribute to food security, climate change mitigation, water retention and plant biomass growth. Healthy soils also help to prevent erosion, desertification, and landslides and to stabilise crop yields. The provision of ES by soil biota is a result of their impact on soil processes in interaction with soil conditions as well as soil management practices of the farmers such as tillage or crop rotations. Some taxa amongst soil biota play key roles in regulating soil processes. With respect to biocontrol of soil-borne pests, the earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris is known to play an important role in suppressing toxigenic plant pathogens, such as Fusarium culmorum and its mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). We highlight the importance of earthworms for pest control to conceptualise and show how farmers' management practices influence soil ecosystem services and outline how this can be examined in a socio-ecological context by providing a concrete example of an economical evaluation of ES provided by earthworms.

In the present study we expanded the investigation of the causative agent to a characterization at strain level and the identification of its phylogenetic position among the L. infantum genotypes circulating worldwide. This is the first study addressing genetic diversity and population structure of L. infantum in Armenia and in Transcaucasia. Armenia is an extremely interesting region due to its bio-geographic specificities e.g. the high number of different climates in this small mountainous country and the observed high diversity of sand fly species, part of which occurring in very high altitudes. Ecological niche modeling based on registered VL cases and sand fly vectors collected in active VL foci revealed that the risk of further spread of VL is very high due to climate change. Studies of this region should be expanded to enable targeted control measures. Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is re-emerging in Armenia since 1999 with 167 cases recorded until 2019. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine for the first time the genetic diversity and population structure of the causative agent of VL in Armenia; (ii) to compare these genotypes with those from most endemic regions worldwide; (iii) to monitor the diversity of vectors in Armenia; (iv) to predict the distribution of the vectors and VL in time and space by ecological niche modeling. Methodology/Principal findings Human samples from different parts of Armenia previously identified by ITS-1-RFLP as L. infantum were studied by Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT). These data were combined with previously typed L. infantum strains from the main global endemic regions for population structure analysis. Within the 23 Armenian L. infantum strains 22 different genotypes were identified. The combined analysis revealed that all strains belong to the worldwide predominating MON1-population, however most closely related to a subpopulation from Southeastern Europe, Maghreb, Middle East and Central Asia. The three observed Armenian clusters grouped within this subpopulation with strains from Greece/Turkey, and from Central Asia, respectively. Ecological niche modeling based on VL cases and collected proven vectors (P. balcanicus, P. kandelakii) identified Yerevan and districts Lori, Tavush, Syunik, Armavir, Ararat bordering Georgia, Turkey, Iran and Azerbaijan as most suitable for the vectors and with the highest risk for VL transmission. Due to climate change the suitable habitat for VL transmission will expand in future all over Armenia. Conclusions Genetic diversity and population structure of the causative agent of VL in Armenia were addressed for the first time. Further genotyping studies should be performed with samples from infected humans, animals and sand flies from all active foci including the neighboring countries to understand transmission cycles, re-emergence, spread, and epidemiology of VL in Armenia and the entire Transcaucasus enabling epidemiological monitoring.

Precipitation can be a key driver of ecosystem functioning in semi-arid and arid grasslands. Altered precipitation patterns had significant impacts on plant community dynamics, which in turn influenced the community composition and structure of higher trophic levels, especially insects, in grasslands. 2. A field experiment was conducted by manipulating the amount of natural precipitation (control, +30% rainfall, and 30% rainfall) to examine the effects of altered precipitation patterns on insect diversity, abundance, and imp-hie structure in a meadow steppe over 3 years (2007-2009), 3. The, results showed that the increased precipitation treatment significantly enhanced above-ground biomass of the entire plant community and particularly grasses, whereas the decreased precipitation treatment significantly reduced them. There were year-to-year changes in species richness, Shannon Wiener index, and abundance of the whole insect community. Both increased and decreased precipitation caused declines in insect species richness and abundance owing to potentially complex vegetation-mediated effects and direct habitat effects. The abundance of each trophic guild in the insect community responded differently to altered precipitation patterns, with lower herbivore abundance and unchanged abundance of predators and parasitoids, Thus changes in precipitation may generate an insect community that is increasingly dominated by secondary consumers. 4. The present results suggest that altered precipitation causes a declines in insect diversity and shifts in trophic structure, potentially influencing ecosystem functioning in grasslands. Additionally, the inter-annual variation in the insect community under altered precipitation highlights the importance of long-term experiments for drawing correct conclusions about the impacts of climate change on grassland ecosystems.

The multidimensional dynamics of biodiversity and ecosystem function during the rewilding of Mediterranean forests remain poorly understood, limiting our capacity to predict how future restoration efforts may help mitigate climate change. 2. Here, we investigated the changes in multiple dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem services in a 120-year forest succession after harvest to identify potential trade-offs in multiple dimensions of ecosystem function, and further assess the link between above and below-ground biodiversity and function. 3. We found a positive influence of successional age on not only multiple dimensions of biodiversity and function but also some important trade-offs. Two ecosystem axes of function explained nearly 75.4% of functional variation during ecosystem rewilding. However, while the first axis increased with successional age promoting plant productivity and element stocks, the second axis followed a hump-shaped relationship with age supporting important reductions in nutrient availability and pathogen control in old forests. Our study further revealed a significant positive relationship between plant and soil biodiversity with multiple elements of multifunctionality as forests develop. Moreover, the influence of plant and soil biodiversity were especially important to support a high number of function working at high levels of functioning. 4. Our work provides new insights on the patterns and functional trade-offs in the multidimensional rewilding of forests and further highlights the importance of biodiversity for long-term Mediterranean rewilding.

Many diseases are specific to the tropics, with at least 41 diseases caused by endemic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Such diseases are of increasing concern, as the geographic range of tropical diseases is expanding due to climate change, urbanization, change in agricultural practices, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. While traditional medicines have been used for centuries in the treatment of tropical diseases, the active natural compounds within these medicines remain largely unknown. In this review, we describe infectious diseases specific to the tropics, including their causative pathogens, modes of transmission, recent major outbreaks, and geographic locations. We further review current treatments for these tropical diseases, carefully consider the biodiscovery potential of the tropical biome, and discuss a range of technologies being used for drug development from natural resources. We provide a list of natural products with antimicrobial activity, detailing the source organisms and their effectiveness as treatment. We discuss how technological advancements, such as next-generation sequencing, are driving high-throughput natural product screening pipelines to identify compounds with therapeutic properties. This review demonstrates the impact natural products from the vast tropical biome have in the treatment of tropical infectious diseases and how high throughput technical capacity will accelerate this discovery process.

The Importance of Mycological and Plant Herbaria in Tracking Plant Killers	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Review								Mycological herbaria contain important records of plant biodiversity and past outbreaks of plant disease. Mycological herbaria have been used to (1) understand the life history of plant pathogens; (2) identify outbreak strains and track their source; (3) understand the landscape ecology, biodiversity, and distribution of native plants and their diseases; and (4) examine the impact of climate change on pests and plant diseases. In this review, recent ecological and evolutionary questions being addressed using mycological herbarium specimens will be discussed followed by a case study on the evolution and migration of the historic outbreak strain of the Irish famine pathogen, Phytophthora infestans.

A. Mey.) Bunge and H. Persicum Bunge ex Boiss and the primary cultivated crop of the desert economy. Its wild resources became scarce due to over-exploitation and poaching for economic benefits. To protect the biological diversity of the desert Haloxylon-Cistanche community forest, the optimal combination of desert ecology and economy industry, and their future survival, this paper examines the conservation areas of wild C. deserticola from the perspective of hosts' effects and climate changes. To identify conservation areas, the potential distributions generated by MaxEnt in two strategies (AH: abiotic and hosts factors; HO: hosts factors only) compare the model's performance, the niche range overlap, and the changing trend in climate changes. The results show the following: (1) The HO strategy is more suitable for prediction and identifying the core conservation areas in hosts and climate changes (indirectly affected by host distributions) for C. deserticola. (2) The low-suitable habitat and the medium-suitable habitat are both sensitive to the climate changes; the reduction reaches 48.2% (SSP585, 2081-2100) and 26.6%(SSP370, 2081-2100), respectively. The highly suitable habitat is always in growth, with growth reaching 27.3% (SSP585, 2081-2100). (3) Core conservation areas and agriculture and education areas are 317,315.118 km(2) and 319,489.874 km(2), respectively. This study developed a predictive model for Maxent under climate change scenarios by limiting host and abiotic factors and inverted the natural habitat of C. deserticola to provide scientific zoning for biodiversity conservation in desert Haloxylon-Cistanche community forests systems, providing an effective reference for decision makers.

ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS				Article								One of the anthropogenic causes affecting species distribution is climate change, which has significant implications for species conservation. However, little is known about the effects of changes in parasitic plant distribution on community-level interactions. Parasitic flowering plants make a limited numerical contribution to biodiversity. Their lifestyle may exhibit a moderate to the high degree of host dependence. Because of this host dependence, parasites may be more affected by environmental changes, such as climate change, compared to autotrophic representatives. To our knowledge, the effects of different climate change scenarios and their environmental variables on parasitic plants and their hosts have not yet been studied. This study aimed to construct a model which shows the current and future potential effects of climate change on the distribution of the two holoparasitic plants Hydnora abyssinica A.Br., and H. africana Thunb. in comparison to their respective Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae hosts. We projected the future distribution of these species and their host plants using five models, nine bioclimatic, and five environmental variables. The global circulation model (CMIP5) for the years 2050 and 2070, applying two representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) projected a 41-64% contraction of suitable habitats for H. abyssinica. For H. africana, more stable conditions are estimated, with a 12-28% contraction in suitable habitats, making this species putatively less prone to climate change effects, although this species has a more restricted distribution compared to H. abyssinica. Because climate change could affect the host differently than the parasites, the impact on the parasite could potentially be exacerbated due to host plant dependence. The models predict that the host plant distribution will be less affected, except for Vachelia Karroo, Vachellia xanthophloea, and Euphorbia gregaria, which indicated high contraction (40-66%). The predicted host species distribution ranges will only partially overlap with the respective distribution of the parasite.

Aquatic invasive species: challenges for the future	HYDROBIOLOGIA				Article								Humans have effectively transported thousands of species around the globe and, with accelerated trade; the rate of introductions has increased over time. Aquatic ecosystems seem at particular risk from invasive species because of threats to biodiversity and human needs for water resources. Here, we review some known aspects of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and explore several new questions. We describe impacts of AIS, factors limiting their dispersal, and the role that humans play in transporting AIS. We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species ("invasional meltdown"). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.

J	Stiles, FG; Rosselli, L; De la Zerda, S				Gary Stiles, F.; Rosselli, Loreta; De la Zerda, Susana			Changes over 26 Years in the Avifauna of the Bogota Region, Colombia: Has Climate Change Become Important?	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Article								High Neotropical mountains are among the most threatened ecosystems by climate change and this problem could be accentuated in cities where temperatures are higher. However, there are few data of long-term avifaunal changes in Neotropical cities, and the potential impact of climate change has yet to be addressed. Using data from 26 years of Audubon's Christmas Bird Counts (CBCs) in the Bogota area (ca. 2,600-3,100m in Colombia's eastern Andes), we analyze long-term changes of the avifauna using linear regressions corrected for species' habitat preferences and compared urban and rural sites. For the CBC we followed the National Audubon Society's methodology in which birds are counted over a 24-h period within a fixed circle 24 km in diameter. We recorded 235 species in the Bogota circle with an average of 122 spp/year, including 46 boreal migrants, three endemic species, and four endemic subspecies, two globally and four locally threatened species. Species richness was higher in rural than in urban areas and most species were associated with native forest and scrub and wetlands. Among the species that were analyzed for changes in time 31% increased, 20% decreased, and 49% did not change. Strong fluctuations or changes in abundance were more frequent in urban than rural environments. Many of the species that increased or became established during the CBC interval came from lower elevations or the warmer, drier parts of the region beyond the count circle. By contrast, the lower elevational limits moved to higher elevations in several species that decreased. Climate change with its related effects represented the factor associated with the most changes in abundance. Other potential causes were direct human actions, mostly associated with urbanization, and "natural" successional changes in vegetation; predation by feral dogs and cowbird parasitism also affected several species negatively. Observations indicate that these factors will continue into the future, and the effects of climate change and urbanization in particular will probably intensify. The Bogota CBC has provided much valuable information for Neotropical urban ornithology and its practice should be encouraged in other Latin American cities and should definitely continue in Bogota for many years to come.

J	Crawford, KM; Hawkes, CV				Crawford, Kerri M.; Hawkes, Christine, V			Soil precipitation legacies influence intraspecific plant-soil feedback	ECOLOGY				Article								Feedbacks between plants and soil microbial communities can play an important role in structuring plant communities. However, little is known about how soil legacies caused by environmental disturbances such as drought and extreme precipitation events may affect plant-soil feedback or whether plant-soil feedback operates within species as it does between species. If soil legacies alter plant-soil feedback among genotypes within a plant species, then soil legacies may alter the diversity within plant populations. We conducted a fully factorial pairwise plant-soil feedback experiment to test how precipitation legacies influenced intraspecific plant-soil feedbacks among three genotypes of a dominant grass species,Panicum virgatum.Panicum virgatumexperienced negative intraspecific plant-soil feedback, i.e., genotypes generally performed worse on soil from the same genotype than different genotypes. Soil precipitation legacies reversed the rank order of the strength of negative feedback among the genotypes. Feedback is often positively correlated with plant relative abundance. Therefore, our results suggest that soil precipitation legacies may alter the genotypic composition ofP. virgatumpopulations, favoring genotypes that develop less negative feedback. Changes in intraspecific diversity will likely further affect community structure and ecosystem functioning, and may constrain the ability of populations to respond to future changes in climate.

J	Unger, P; Klimpel, S; Lang, T; Palm, HW				Unger, Patrick; Klimpel, Sven; Lang, Thomas; Palm, Harry Wilhelm			Metazoan parasites from herring (Clupea harengus L.) as biological indicators in the Baltic Sea	ACTA PARASITOLOGICA				Article								Zoographical distribution of metazoan fish parasites in herring, Clupea harengus, from the Baltic Sea was analysed in order to use them as potential biological indicators. A total of 210 herring from six different sampling sites were investigated, harbouring 12 different parasite species [five digeneans (D), one cestode (C), three nematodes (N) and three acanthocephalans (A)]. The distribution of the parasite species differed according to region, with a distinct gradient of decreasing species richness towards the east of the Baltic Sea. The western localities at Kiel Bay, Rugen and Poland had the highest parasite diversity, including the marine parasite species Anisakis simplex (s.s.) (N), Brachyphallus crenatus and Hemiurus luehei (both D). The eastern localities had low parasite species richness, predominated by the freshwater digenean Diplostomum spathaceum. We could identify three different Baltic herring stocks, the spring-spawning herring of the western Baltic reaching from the Kattegat to the German and Polish coast, the stock of the central Baltic proper and the northern stock of C. harengus var. membras of the Gulf of Finland. The limited distribution of the herring parasites within the Baltic Sea enables their use as biological indicators for migration patterns and stock separation. The acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis that has already been used as an accumulation bioindicator for heavy metals was only recorded for the western herring stocks. However, the presence of mainly generalistic parasites and their uneven distribution patterns make their use as indicators for regional environmental and global change more difficult.

J	Mitchell, CE; Reich, PB; Tilman, D; Groth, JV				Mitchell, CE; Reich, PB; Tilman, D; Groth, JV			Effects of elevated CO2, nitrogen deposition, and decreased species diversity on foliar fungal plant disease	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Three components of global change, elevated CO2, nitrogen addition, and decreased plant species richness ('diversity'), increased the percent leaf area infected by fungi (pathogen load) for much to all of the plant community in one year of a factorial grassland experiment. Decreased plant diversity had the broadest effect, increasing pathogen load across the plant community. Decreased diversity increased pathogen load primarily by allowing remaining plant species to increase in abundance, facilitating spread of foliar fungal pathogens specific to each plant species. Changes in plant species composition also strongly influenced community pathogen load, with communities that lost less disease prone plant species increasing more in pathogen load. Elevated CO2 increased pathogen load of C-3 grasses, perhaps by decreasing water stress, increasing leaf longevity, and increasing photosynthetic rate, all of which can promote foliar fungal disease. Decreased plant diversity further magnified the increase in C-3 grass pathogen load under elevated CO2. Nitrogen addition increased pathogen load of C-4 grasses by increasing foliar nitrogen concentration, which can enhance pathogen infection, growth, and reproduction. Because changes in foliar fungal pathogen load can strongly influence grassland ecosystem processes, our study suggests that increased pathogen load can be an important mechanism by which global change affects grassland ecosystems.

SESPAS Report 2022	GACETA SANITARIA				Review								The new pandemic, COVID-19, highlighted the importance of the animal-human-environment interface in the emergence of zoonoses. The jump of the species barrier is considered a rare event although the number of emerging infectious diseases increased significantly in the second half of the 20th century. Most of them transmitted from wildlife to humans. Several elements can contribute to the emergence of zoonoses: human interaction on ecosystems, biodiversity loss, changes in land use, climate change, trade in or consumption of wildlife. There are different stages in the adaptation of an animal pathogen into a specialized human pathogen, varying from its presence in animals without human infection to a pathogen exclusive to humans. The history of zoonoses allows the identification of critical points for their control, as well as the identification of probable virus or bacteria involved in future pandemics. Concerning COVID-19, the knowledge of the possible reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to decision-making during the pandemic. Therefore, and given the variety of scenarios that allow the jump of species barrier or the evolution of pathogens in a new host, One Health strategies for zoonosis emergence surveillance should be implemented.

J	Swynghedauw, B				Swynghedauw, Bernard			Health consequences of environmental temperature and climate variations	BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE				Article								Recent climate change is a consequence of the greenhouse effect and human activity, and is directly responsible for extreme events such as heatwaves (see report of the French Academie des Sciences). Human thermoregulation depends more on behavior than on biology Air conditioning and building structure play an essential role. The 2003 heatwave was not a unique event. Preventive measures reduced mortality during subsequent heatwaves. Most deaths were due to heat stroke associated with dehydration. During strenuous exercise, especially during military training, heat stroke requires specific treatment. Temperature/global mortality and temperature/cardiovascular mortality curves are both U-shaped. Usually, global mortality increases winter and is linked to temperature. During summer global mortality increases only when heatwaves occur Climate change participates in the spread of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, in continental France, for the moment, climate change is not a major factor in the incidence of infectious diseases, despite the fact that several bacteria, viruses and vectors are temperature-sensitive. The situation in Reunion, French Polynesia and French Departments of America is more complicated, due to their geographic heterogeneity Some areas are more exposed to the climatic risk and could act as a gateway for new infections and mutations. The dramatic loss of biodiversity is partly a consequence of climate change. It increases the transmissibility of some pathogens and can also potentially lead to an increase in auto immune diseases and obesity Climate change plays a important role in allergic diseases, through changes in the diffusion and composition of pollens. These modifications are being monitored by several observatories. Six different veterinary diseases, including several zoonoses, are of particular concern.				bernard.swynghedauw@inserm.fr								2	2											JAN	2012	196	1					201	215		10.1016/S0001-4079(19)31865-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0001-4079(19)31865-5				Medicine, General & Internal				23259344				2023-09-28	WOS:000311703500031

Studies on forest health and vegetation changes in Greece under the effects of climate changes	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				Article								Greece, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, is projected to be among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is therefore quite urgent to adapt forest management to the changing climate in order to enhance biodiversity and to enable the conservation of healthy and productive forests. In the framework of the project LIFE+ AdaptFor (www.life-adaptfor.gr), an effort was made to understand the ecological responses and the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in the face of climate change; the overall aim of the project is the development and implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies. Four study areas were selected where changes in vegetation, quite likely attributed to climate change, have already been observed (dieback of Scots pine and Greek fir, intrusion of conifers in broadleaved forests). To investigate the synergism of climatic parameters' alterations in the development of the occurring phenomena, time series of temperature and precipitation for the period 1950-2009 were produced and parameters of forest status were investigated, including mapping of vegetation changes through remote sensing. The findings support the hypothesis that climate change has an impact on forest health; the dieback of tree species can be attributed to outbreaks of pathogens (fungi and insects) which are associated with climatic parameters. However, the intrusion of conifer species into broadleaved forests showed no direct connection to climatic parameters, something that needs to be further investigated. In all cases, insufficient or inappropriate management practices applied in the areas exacerbated the occurring phenomena.

J	Aguirre, AA				Aguirre, A. Alonso			Wild canids as sentinels of ecological health: a conservation medicine perspective	PARASITES & VECTORS				Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Symposium on Canine Vector-Borne Diseases	MAR 25-28, 2009	Seville, SPAIN					The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating, directly or indirectly due to human activities. Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence, driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. The emerging discipline of conservation medicine addresses these concerns through the following entities: humans; global climate; habitat destruction and alteration; biodiversity, including wildlife populations; domestic animals; and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. Furthermore, conservation medicine focuses on explicit linkages between these entities. As a crisis discipline, the usefulness of conservation medicine ultimately will depend on its applicability to solving problems. The perspectives and scientific findings of conservation medicine provide input into biomedical education; and policy and management of ecosystems, habitats and imperiled species. A sentinel species is one that has presented itself, or has been selected, to provide insight into the state (health) of an ecosystem, based on user-defined (e. g., researchers, conservationists or policymakers) objectives (e. g., disease, parasites, toxics, climate change, habitat destruction), coupled with the utility and vulnerability of this species to the perceived stress. The scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders and decision-makers to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities; the "utility" of the species selected should consider its value and relevance to conservationists and to society at large (e. g., education and outreach; social sciences). Wild canids may serve as excellent sentinel species of emerging canine vector-borne diseases. Several canine vector-borne diseases or antibodies to these pathogens have been identified in wild canids including visceral leishmaniosis, Lyme disease, heartworm, hepatozoonosis and anaplasmosis to name a few. These reports are relatively recent as they relate to wildlife-domestic animal interactions, globalisation, translocations, habitat fragmentation and climate change. These pathogens and their relationship to wild canids are described herein. Further research needs to be performed to elucidate the role of the 36 extant species of wild canids in the epidemiology of canine vector-borne diseases.

Harnessing Diversity in Wheat to Enhance Grain Yield, Climate Resilience, Disease and Insect Pest Resistance and Nutrition Through Conventional and Modern Breeding Approaches	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				Review								Current trends in population growth and consumption patterns continue to increase the demand for wheat, a key cereal for global food security. Further, multiple abiotic challenges due to climate change and evolving pathogen and pests pose a major concern for increasing wheat production globally. Triticeae species comprising of primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools represent a rich source of genetic diversity in wheat. The conventional breeding strategies of direct hybridization, backcrossing and selection have successfully introgressed a number of desirable traits associated with grain yield, adaptation to abiotic stresses, disease resistance, and bio-fortification of wheat varieties. However, it is time consuming to incorporate genes conferring tolerance/resistance to multiple stresses in a single wheat variety by conventional approaches due to limitations in screening methods and the lower probabilities of combining desirable alleles. Efforts on developing innovative breeding strategies, novel tools and utilizing genetic diversity for new genes/alleles are essential to improve productivity, reduce vulnerability to diseases and pests and enhance nutritional quality. New technologies of high-throughput phenotyping, genome sequencing and genomic selection are promising approaches to maximize progeny screening and selection to accelerate the genetic gains in breeding more productive varieties. Use of cisgenic techniques to transfer beneficial alleles and their combinations within related species also offer great promise especially to achieve durable rust resistance.

J	Chelomina, GN; Tatonova, YV; Hung, NM; Ngo, HD				Chelomina, Galina N.; Tatonova, Yulia V.; Nguyen Manh Hung; Ha Duy Ngo			Genetic diversity of the Chinese liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis from Russia and Vietnam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				Article								Clonorchiasis is a parasitic disease of high public health importance in many countries in southeastern Asia and is caused by the Chinese liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. However, the genetic structure and demographic history of its populations has not been sufficiently studied throughout the geographic range of the species and available data are based mainly on partial gene sequencing. In this study, we explored the genetic diversity of the complete 1560 bp cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene sequence for geographically isolated C sinensis populations in Russia and Vietnam, to our knowledge for the first time. The results demonstrated low nucleotide and high haplotype differentiation within and between the two compared regions and a clear geographical vector for the distribution of genetic diversity patterns among the studied populations. These results suggest a deep local adaptation of the parasite to its environment including intermediate hosts and the existence of gene flow across the species' range. Additionally, we have predicted an amino acid substitution in the functional site of the COX1 protein among the Vietnamese populations, which were reported to be difficult to treat with praziquantel. The haplotype networks consisted of several region-specific phylogenetic lineages, the formation of which could have occurred during the most extensive penultimate glaciations in the Pleistocene Epoch. The patterns of genetic diversity and demographics are consistent with population growth of the liver fluke in the late Pleistocene following the Last Glacial Maximum, indicating the lack of a population bottleneck during the recent past in the species' history. The data obtained have important implications for understanding the phylogeography of C sinensis, its host-parasite interactions, the ability of this parasite to evolve drug resistance, and the epidemiology of clonorchiasis under global climate change.

However, analysis of ecological feedback pathways remains a challenge. In this study, single and mixed plant communities in different soil ecosystems were screened using strict control systems in global ecosystems to identify the positive or negative feedback effects in indicator plants. Furthermore, the plant components and biomass were identified in each pathway. The significantly changed components indicated pathway factors. As negative feedback increased, the InRR (Response Ratio) of soil organic matter, soil total N, microbial alpha diversity and the symbiotic fungi proportion were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). In contrast, the stoichiometric ratio (C: N), water content, and the pathogenic bacteria proportion were downregulated (P < 0.05). However, the positive feedback showed the opposite trend. Importantly, N limit as a transform node between positive and negative plant-soil feedback predicted by Akaike information criterion (AIC > 0.8). Therefore, it has become an important evaluation standard for the inter-species relationship and ecological environment changes under the background of global N deposition. Finally, the feedback values of each sampling site were recalculated over the next 20 years, 50 years, and 100 years based on the global temperature rise and changing rainfall patterns. We also found that global warming and extreme rainfall may change the distribution of interspecies relationships on a global scale, with global warming having the greatest recognisable effect and decreasing the negative feedback layout by 21.7% (P < 0.05). Therefore, this work promotes the cognition of relationship of soil environment, microbial abundance and function, plant diversity and plant- soil feedback model. Meanwhile, it is of great significance to protect species diversity and restore environmental degradation.

J	Stout, L; Garenne, A; de Montaudouin, X				Stout, Leslie; Garenne, Andre; de Montaudouin, Xavier			Marine trematode parasites as indicators of environmental changes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				Article								Coastal ecosystems are threatened by growing pressures related to global change. The evaluation of an ecosystem's biodiversity and status is by consequence of increasing importance to assess potentially undergone changes and predict their future trajectory for management and conservancy purposes. Biotic indicators sensitive to ecosystem changes are thus continuously sought for. Trematode parasite communities were examined as potential indicators of environmental changes, considering that the achievement of their complex life cycle is modulated by several factors. Indeed, the rule for trematode is that each species complete their cycle by a succession of three different host species and two free-living stages, thus depending on several biotic and abiotic factors. To this end, we examined the trematode community infecting the common cockle in Banc d'Arguin, Arcachon Bay, France. Monthly data extending over 16 years and sampled at a single station were compared to field book notes describing the changes of the closely surrounding landscape. In 2021, we also sampled cockles at 15 stations presenting different substrate features along the bank. Over time, seven out of nine changes of the trematode community structure presented concordances with changes in landscape. We hypothesize this was related to the environment heterogeneous substrate (i.e., temporal succession of oyster parks, bare sands and seagrass) with cascading effects on host populations. However, some changes could not solely be explained by changes in landscape. Our spatial study showed that the trematode communities exhibited intricate infection patterns with a complex interaction between substrate heterogeneity and larval dispersal ability of parasites. Thus, trematode communities might be potential indicators of subtle changes in the environment. However, it remains unclear which scale of environmental changes trematodes are actually sensitive to.

S	Lloret, F; Batllori, E		Jackson, RB; Canadell, JG		Lloret, Francisco; Batllori, Enric			Climate-Induced Global Forest Shifts due to Heatwave-Drought	ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE AND CLIMATE CHANGE	Ecological Studies-Analysis and Synthesis			Article; Book Chapter								Episodes of forest mortality attributed to extreme climate variability (e.g. droughts, heatwaves) associated with climate change are increasingly reported in most biomes. The severity and extent of the mortality are also modulated by soils and topography characteristics and the presence of other disturbances such as pests, pathogens, wildfires, windthrow, and past management. Palaeoecological and historical information show that drought-induced forests shifts have occurred in the past in many regions. However, anthropogenic causes are key determinants in current drought-induced transformations of forests to non-forested ecosystems. The role of forest mortality leading to forest collapse is poorly understood, especially given the lack of long-term ecological surveys. In the short term, we find that an alternate set of species usually takes over the previously dominant tree species in temperate and boreal forests, through gap dynamics. In our global review, trees are replaced by shrubs in 34% of the cases studied and by grasses in 10% of the cases, pointing to characteristics of forest collapse in the latter more extreme case. Overall these episodes promote a wide array of changes framed in a successional context, usually towards more xeric and herbaceous vegetation. The eventual forest dynamics are largely defined by the historical context and particularly by human management, in which to a large extent determines the species pool, forest structure, and regeneration patterns. Early warning signals of ecosystem shifts based on long-term monitoring and statistics appear essential to anticipate forest collapse. Remote sensing tools constitute a powerful tool for the assessment of changes in forest functional properties. However, when analysing forest dynamics and processes based on biodiversity, the information provided by remote sensing merits further research. We find limited evidence of widespread forest collapse at the global scale, but ongoing mortality events represent a "window to the future" to understand forest resilience in light of increased frequency of climatic extremes.

J	Poulin, R				Poulin, Robert			The rise of ecological parasitology: twelve landmark advances that changed its history	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				Review								In the five decades since the first publication of the International Journal for Parasitology, ecological parasitology has grown from modest beginnings to become a modern discipline with a strong theoretical foundation, a diverse toolkit, and a multidisciplinary approach. In this review, I highlight 12 advances in the field that have spurred its growth over the past 50 years. Where relevant, I identify pivotal contributions that have altered the course of research, as well as the influence of developments in other fields such as mainstream ecology and molecular biology. The 12 key advances discussed are in areas including parasite population dynamics and community assembly, the regulation of host population abundance and food web structure, parasites as agents of natural selection, the impacts of biodiversity and anthropogenic changes on host-parasite interactions, the biogeography of parasite diversity, and the evolutionary genetics of parasites.

J	Alba, A; Vazquez, AA; Hurtrez-Bousses, S				Alba, Annia; Vazquez, Antonio A.; Hurtrez-Bousses, Sylvie			Towards the comprehension of fasciolosis (re-)emergence: an integrative overview	PARASITOLOGY				Review								The increasing distribution and prevalence of fasciolosis in both human and livestock are concerning. Here, we examine the various types of factors influencing fasciolosis transmission and burden and the interrelations that may exist between them. We present the arsenal of molecules, 'adjusting' capabilities and parasitic strategies of Fasciola to infect. Such features define the high adaptability of Fasciola species for parasitism that facilitate their transmission. We discuss current environmental perturbations (increase of livestock and land use, climate change, introduction of alien species and biodiversity loss) in relation to fasciolosis dynamics. As Fasciola infection is directly and ultimately linked to livestock management, living conditions and cultural habits, which are also changing under the pressure of globalization and climate change, the social component of transmission is also discussed. Lastly, we examine the implication of increasing scientific and political awareness in highlighting the current circulation of fasciolosis and boosting epidemiological surveys and novel diagnostic techniques. From a joint perspective, it becomes clear that factors weight differently at each place and moment, depending on the biological, environmental, social and political interrelating contexts. Therefore, the analyses of a disease as complex as fasciolosis should be as integrative as possible to dissect the realities featuring each epidemiological scenario. Such a comprehensive appraisal is presented in this review and constitutes its main asset to serve as a fresh integrative understanding of fasciolosis.

J	Azevedo, M; Figueiredo, E; Rebelo, MT				Azevedo, Miguel; Figueiredo, Elisabete; Rebelo, Maria Teresa			The bee fauna (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) of allotments in downtown Lisbon	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY				Article								In the last ten years, a growing number of studies have focused on urban green areas as potential refuges for biodiversity, where private gardens, urban parks and green roofs have relatively high diversities of wild bees. However, the western Mediterranean is still poorly studied and is a biodiversity hotspot that is already suffering the consequences of climate change. It is essential to rectify this and understand how urban settings can support biodiversity. In this context, this study provides an assessment of the taxonomic and functional composition of bee assemblages in three allotments in downtown Lisbon, Portugal. Using only an entomological net, we collected 202 specimens from April to July 2018, belonging to fi ve families, 20 genera and 58 species, of which six are rare species in Portugal and nine first records for the Lisbon district. Megachilidae was the most diverse family, comprising 15 species, while Apidae was the most abundant family. Most of the species identifi ed were solitary and had a generalist pollen diet, with a low incidence of social and parasitic species.

J	Aguirre, H; Shaw, SR; Rodriguez-Jimenez, A				Aguirre, Helmuth; Shaw, Scott R.; Rodriguez-Jimenez, Andrea			Contrasting patterns of altitudinal distribution between parasitoid wasps of the subfamilies Braconinae and Doryctinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY				Article								Many tropical organisms have narrow altitudinal ranges and therefore may be especially vulnerable to climate change. Parasitoid wasps are no exception, so baseline knowledge about their vulnerability to rising temperatures needs to include analyses of their distributional ranges along elevational gradients. Using museum collections of the parasitoid subfamilies Braconinae and Doryctinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) from Costa Rica, we tested two alternative hypotheses explaining altitudinal distributions of communities: (i) the Mid-domain effect, which states that species diversity peaks at middle elevations as a result of species' random distributions; and (ii) Rapoport's effect, which predicts that species diversity should monotonically decrease with increasing elevation. We found that for the Doryctinae, species diversity decreased monotonically with elevation, while the Braconinae showed two peaks. Species altitudinal ranges increased with elevation in the Doryctinae, as predicted by Rapoport's effect, but not so in the Braconinae. Neither of the subfamilies' distributions fit the prediction of the Mid-domain effect. The richness peak at low elevations displayed by the Braconinae and Doryctinae matches the distribution of wood-boring beetles, which are potential hosts for both taxa. The second peak described in the Braconinae at middle elevations may reflect either better access or higher availability of potential hosts in the Diptera and Lepidoptera at those elevations. Because species in the Doryctinae, on average, had altitudinal ranges that were broader and lower in elevation than species in the Braconinae, our results suggest that species in the Doryctinae might have greater resilience to future temperature increases.

In addition, direct effects of extreme weather events remain understudied. Simultaneous investigation of the significance of ectoparasites on host populations and extreme weather events is lacking, especially in the Arctic. Here we document the consequences of recent black fly outbreaks and extreme precipitation events on the reproductive output of an arctic top predator, the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus tundrius) nesting at the northern range limit of ornithophilic black flies in Nunavut, Canada. Overall, black fly outbreaks and heavy rain reduced annual nestling survival by up to 30% and 50% respectively. High mortality caused by ectoparasites followed record-breaking spring snow precipitation, which likely increased stream discharge and nutrient runoff, two key parameters involved in growth and survival of blackfly larvae. Using the RCP4.5 intermediate climate scenario run under the Canadian Global Climate Model, we anticipate a northward expansion of blackfly distribution in Arctic regions. Our case study demonstrates that, in the context of climate change, extreme weather events can have substantial direct and indirect effects on reproductive output of an arctic top-predator population.

Various stressors, such as the conversion of natural habitats, climate change, land-use intensification, agrochemicals and pathogens, are thought to be major factors in this decline. We treated female bees of two common pollinator species in Europe, Osmia bicornis and Bombus terrestris, with a field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid clothianidin. We tested its effects on the foraging behavior of O. bicornis under semi-natural conditions and on the antennal sensitivity of both bee species to common floral volatiles by using electroantennography. Clothianidin negatively affected the foraging behavior in O. bicornis by decreasing the number of flowers visited per foraging flight and by increasing the time per flower visit and the searching time between two flowers. It also decreased the antennal sensitivity to 2-phenylethanol in the two bee species. Thus, clothianidin is clearly a threat for bees via its effects on their foraging behavior and antennal sensitivity and is hence probably detrimental for pollination and the reproductive success of bees.</p>	[Straub, Florian; Orih, Ihotu Joy; Kimmich, Judith; Ayasse, Manfred] Ulm Univ, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Dept Biol, Ulm, Germany		Ayasse, M (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Genom, Dept Biol, Ulm, Germany.	manfred.ayasse@uni-ulm.de								8	8											SEP 3	2021	9								697355	10.3389/fevo.2021.697355	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.697355				Ecology								2023-09-28	WOS:000696709500001

J	Sopniewski, J; Scheele, BC; Cardillo, M				Sopniewski, Jarrod; Scheele, Benjamin C.; Cardillo, Marcel			Predicting the distribution of Australian frogs and their overlap with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis under climate change	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				Article								Aim Amphibians, with over 40% of assessed species listed as threatened, are disproportionately at risk in the global extinction crisis. Among the many factors implicated in the ongoing loss of amphibian biodiversity are climate change and the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). These threats are of particular concern in Australia, where Bd has been implicated in the declines of at least 43 frog species, and climate change is emerging as an additional threat. We explore how climate change is likely to affect the distributions of Australian frog species and Bd to the year 2100, and how the spatial and climatic niche overlap between chytridiomycosis-declined frogs and Bd could shift. Location Australia. Methods We used species distribution modelling to infer the current and future distribution of 141 Australian frog species and Bd, under two emissions scenarios. We used various metrics of niche similarity to quantify predicted alterations to spatial interactions between Bd and frog species. Results Climate change is likely to have a variable impact on frog distributions in Australia, with some 23 and 47 species, primarily in southern Australia, predicted to lose at least 30% of their current distributions under low and high emissions scenarios, respectively. In contrast, 69 and 68 species, respectively, have potential to increase their distributions, primarily in northern Australia. While the distribution of Bd is predicted to decrease, the proportional spatial and niche overlap between Bd and susceptible frog species is predicted to remain little changed, and in some cases, to increase. Main conclusions Although effects will be variable across the continent, climate change is likely to be a threatening factor to many Australian frog species. Additionally, chytridiomycosis is likely to remain a significant threat to many frog species, as any reductions to the pathogen's distribution largely coincide with geographic range contractions of chytridiomycosis-susceptible species.

A better understanding of the structure of microbial communities and how they are affected by different environmental factors is needed to predict and manage ecosystem responses to climate change. In this study, we carried out a country-wide analysis of fungal communities associated with Pinus sylvestris growing under different environmental conditions. Needle, shoot, root, mineral, and organic soil samples were collected at 30 sites. By interconnecting the high-throughput sequencing data, environmental variables, and soil chemical properties, we were able to identify key factors that drive the diversity and composition of fungal communities associated with P. sylvestris. The fungal species richness and community composition were also found to be highly dependent on the site and the substrate they colonize. The results demonstrated that different functional tissues and the rhizosphere soil of P. sylvestris are associated with diverse fungal communities, which are driven by a combination of climatic (temperature and precipitation) and edaphic factors (soil pH), and stand characteristics.

J	Uribe-Soto, M; Gomez, AP; Ramirez-Nieto, G				Uribe-Soto, Manuel; Patricia Gomez, Arlen; Ramirez-Nieto, Gloria			Influenza needs an approach as a "one health" problem in Colombia	ACTA BIOLOGICA COLOMBIANA				Article								Influenza is an important viral disease of worldwide distribution. It is caused by the Alfainfluenzavirus or influenza virus type A (IAV). A segmented ssRNA genome in the influenza viruses confers high variability and reassortment capability to the virus. That and the broad range of susceptible hosts, along with the possibility of inter-species transmission, represents a challenge to human and animal health. The IAV is able to infect a large variety of hosts such as several wild and domestic avian and mammalian species, including humans, as well as reptiles and amphibians, among others. There are 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes recognized until know, whose main reservoir are the wild aquatic birds. In addition, two new subtypes (H17-18 and N10-11) have been recognized in bats, and these have been designated as influenza-like viruses. Taking this into account and knowing the richness of biodiversity in Colombia, there is an imperative need to study and to know about the IAV circulating in the field in order to establish risk factors and to analyze the past, the current and the future effect that climate change, sociodemographic factors and the role that different species could play in the eco-biology of this viral agent. This should be considered under the one health concept of influenza virus infection as a whole, considering the fact that Colombia is a country in which the circulation of IAV has been demonstrated in the swine and human population and there are preliminary results of the presence of Orthomyxovirus in bats.

The role of pioneers as indicators of biogeographic range expansion caused by global change in southern African coastal waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE				Article								The South African coastline is just over 3000 km in length yet it covers three major biogeographic regions, namely subtropical, warm temperate and cool temperate. In this review we examine published information to assess the possible role of climate change in driving distributional changes of a wide variety of organisms around the subcontinent. In particular we focus on harmful algal blooms, seaweeds, eelgrass, mangroves, salt marsh plants, foraminiferans, stromatolites, corals, squid, zooplankton, zoobenthos, fish, birds, crocodiles and hippopotamus, but also refer to biota such as pathogens, coralline algae, jellyfish and otters. The role of pioneers or propagules as indicators of an incipient range expansion are discussed, with mangroves, zoobenthos, fishes and birds providing the best examples of actual and imminent distributional changes. The contraction of the warm temperate biogeographic region, arising from the intrusion of cool upwelled waters along the Western Cape shores, and increasingly warm Agulhas Current waters penetrating along the eastern parts of the subcontinent, are highlighted. The above features provide an ideal setting for the monitoring of biotic drivers and responses to global climate change over different spatial and temporal scales, and have direct relevance to similar studies being conducted elsewhere in the world. We conclude that, although this review focuses mainly on the impact of global climate change on South African coastal biodiversity, other anthropogenic drivers of change such as introduced alien invasive species may act synergistically with climate change, thereby compounding both short and long-term changes in the distribution and abundance of indigenous species.

Fungal communities in soils under global change	STUDIES IN MYCOLOGY				Article								Soil fungi play indispensable roles in all ecosystems including the recycling of organic matter and interactions with plants, both as symbionts and pathogens. Past observations and experimental manipulations indicate that projected global change effects, including the increase of CO2 concentration, temperature, change of precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition, affect fungal species and communities in soils. Although the observed effects depend on the size and duration of change and reflect local conditions, increased N deposition seems to have the most profound effect on fungal communities. The plant-mutualistic fungal guilds ??? ectomycorrhizal fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ??? appear to be especially responsive to global change factors with N deposition and warming seemingly having the strongest adverse effects. While global change effects on fungal biodiversity seem to be limited, multiple studies demonstrate increases in abundance and dispersal of plant pathogenic fungi. Additionally, ecosystems weakened by global change-induced phenomena, such as drought, are more vulnerable to pathogen outbreaks. The shift from mutualistic fungi to plant pathogens is likely the largest potential threat for the future functioning of natural and managed ecosystems.

Forests are the dominant terrestrial biome in Hawai'i, spanning complex, heterogeneous climates across substrates that vary tremendously in age, soil structure, and nutrient availability. Species richness is low in Hawaiian forests compared to other tropical forests, as a consequence of dispersal limitation from continents and adaptive radiations in only some lineages, and forests are dominated by the widespread Metrosideros species complex. Low species richness provides a relatively tractable model system for studies of community assembly, local adaptation, and species interactions. Moreover, Hawaiian forests provide insights into predicted patterns of evolution on islands, revealing that while some evidence supports "island syndromes," there are exceptions to them all. For example, Hawaiian plants are not as a whole less defended against herbivores, less dispersible, more conservative in resource use, or more slowgrowing than their continental relatives. Clearly, more work is needed to understand the drivers, sources, and constraints on phenotypic variation among Hawaiian species, including both widespread and rare species, and to understand the role of this variation for ecological and evolutionary processes, which will further contribute to conservation of this unique biota. Today, Hawaiian forests are among the most threatened globally. Resource management failures - the proliferation of non-native species in particular - have led to devastating declines in native taxa and resulted in dominance by novel species assemblages. Conservation and restoration of Hawaiian forests now rely on managing threats including climate change, ongoing species introductions, novel pathogens, lost mutualists, and altered ecosystem dynamics through the use of diverse tools and strategies grounded in basic ecological, evolutionary, and biocultural principles. The future of Hawaiian forests thus depends on the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary research, which will continue to inform future conservation and restoration practices.

Hardwood floodplain forests are temperate lowland broad-leaved forest ecosystems typical of extensive river valleys. In Central Europe, stands represent biodiversity hotspots for woody species (as habitats for rare tree species such as Ulmus laevis and Populus nigra), but also host numerous fungi and animal species typical of floodplains. Since floodplains have been subject to river regulation activities for centuries, to date less than 10% of the former natural area of floodplain forests remained. Current threats are overexploitation, cultivation of non-native tree species, floodplain construction projects accompanied by drainage, eutrophication, invasive species, and outbreaks of elm and ash dieback by fungi infections and climate change. River flooding constitutes an important abiotic site factor, which in turn is responsible for site-specific disturbance processes such as ice drift, sedimentation or erosion. Remnants of near-natural hardwood floodplain forests are of outstanding conservation value and deserve protection within large-scale nature reserves in riverine landscapes. Successful restoration requires to reestablish the flooding regime, as a precondition for the reintroduction of important plant, fungi, and animal species originating from appropriate donor populations.

L.; Reinhold, Wilfred			Invasions of vector-borne diseases driven by transportation and climate change	EMERGING PESTS AND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES IN EUROPE	Ecology and Control of Vector-Borne Diseases			Article; Book Chapter								Biological invasions are as old as life itself but have become increasingly frequent due to the globalisation of travel and transportation. During the latest decades, climate change has become an additional driver. Vector-borne diseases, too, are invading more frequently, following an invasion of a vector, a pathogen, a reservoir host or a combination of these. In the past, such invasions have had dramatic effects on public health (e.g. the plague in Europe), livestock health (e.g. bluetongue in southern Europe) or wildlife (e.g. avian malaria on Hawaii). As the volume and speed of travel and transportation increase and climate change continues, more invasions of vector-borne diseases are to be expected, also in Europe. Recent arrivals include the West-Nile, Usutu and bluetongue viruses and the mosquito vector Aedes albopictus (Skuse). Around 12 arboviruses are potential candidates for invasion in Europe in the next decades as well as at least one rickettsia, one bacterium and two protozoa. However, the likelihood of such invasions is small in most cases. The main vectors involved are ticks and Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Two serious threats are invasions of the Chikungunya and dengue viruses in southern Europe, where the competent vector Ae. albopictus has already become established. In fact, at the time of writing this article (August 2007) an outbreak of Chikungunya occurred in Italy (see Chapter 10). An increasingly important risk route for disease introductions is that between East Asia and Europe. Whilst most climate-driven invasions cannot be prevented, many transportation-driven invasions can be. This requires a precautionary approach based on risk analyses, preventive measures in the country of origin, intensive surveillance, early warning and interception. High-risk trade flows for pathogens, such as live animals, and for mosquitoes, such as used tyres and water-filled containers, should be strictly regulated or even reduced. If, however, an introduced vector or pathogen has inadvertedly become established, it should be eradicated as soon as possible. Mosquito invaders can be eradicated by draining water pools, application of insecticides, or use of biological larvicides. Pathogens can be eradicated by vector control, vaccination of infected people or livestock and isolation and treatment of infected hosts. Culling of infected livestock is another option. International agreements such as the Convention on Biodiversity and the International Health Regulations encourage preventive measures, and the world trade regulations allow restrictions on trade if and when the health of humans and animals is at stake. The ultimate policy goal would be to replace free trade by safe trade.	[van der Weijden, Wouter J.; Marcelis, Rene A.

J	Dillen, M; Smit, C; Verheyen, K				Dillen, Mathias; Smit, Christian; Verheyen, Kris			How does neighbourhood tree species composition affect growth characteristics of oak saplings?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				Article								Recent research into positive effects of species diversity has renewed interest into mixing tree species in managed forests. Mixing tree species may have positive effects on productivity and other forest ecosystem functions, while also reducing the impact of extreme weather events or disease - both expected to become worse in the context of global change. In particular saplings are very vulnerable to attacks by pathogens and positive effects at this stage may play a substantial role in shaping later forest dynamics, biomass yields and other ecosystem services. While positive effects of mixing tree species have been found, which species were mixed specifically had large impact on the results and it was often unclear just how these interactions work and what their impact is on tree physiology. In this study, we investigated the impact of local neighbourhood tree species composition on various above- and belowground growth characteristics of four year old oak (Quercus robur and petraea) saplings in two sites with contrasting abiotic conditions. To evaluate specific mechanisms underlying composition effects, we attempted to link these characteristics to the degree of oak powdery mildew infections and shading cast by local neighbourhood trees, two important factors influencing oak sapling survival and growth. Our results showed no impact of neighbourhood tree species richness, but there were strong effects of species identity on dry biomass production and total leaf area in an abiotically more favorable site. These effects of species presence were related to a strong negative impact of powdery mildew and the degree of shading, both affected differently by different tree species. Effects of composition, mildew and shading were much weaker in the abiotically less favorable site, but we could not disentangle this effect from a difference in oak species. Our results suggest that admixing certain tree species can have considerable positive impact. Mixing of species on an individual basis can be generally recommended, particularly if high impact specialist pathogens such as oak powdery mildew are to be expected. However, differences in juvenile growth rates need to be taken into account, as they may lead to strong adverse effects of shading. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rethinking the extrinsic incubation period of malaria parasites	PARASITES & VECTORS				Review								The time it takes for malaria parasites to develop within a mosquito, and become transmissible, is known as the extrinsic incubation period, or EIP. EIP is a key parameter influencing transmission intensity as it combines with mosquito mortality rate and competence to determine the number of mosquitoes that ultimately become infectious. In spite of its epidemiological significance, data on EIP are scant. Current approaches to estimate EIP are largely based on temperature-dependent models developed from data collected on parasite development within a single mosquito species in the 1930s. These models assume that the only factor affecting EIP is mean environmental temperature. Here, we review evidence to suggest that in addition to mean temperature, EIP is likely influenced by genetic diversity of the vector, diversity of the parasite, and variation in a range of biotic and abiotic factors that affect mosquito condition. We further demonstrate that the classic approach of measuring EIP as the time at which mosquitoes first become infectious likely misrepresents EIP for a mosquito population. We argue for a better understanding of EIP to improve models of transmission, refine predictions of the possible impacts of climate change, and determine the potential evolutionary responses of malaria parasites to current and future mosquito control tools.

The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Review								The effects of species declines and extinction on biotic interactions remain poorly understood. The loss of a species is expected to result in the loss of other species that depend on it (coextinction), leading to cascading effects across trophic levels. Such effects are likely to be most severe in mutualistic and parasitic interactions. Indeed, models suggest that coextinction may be the most common form of biodiversity loss. Paradoxically, few historical or contemporary coextinction events have actually been recorded. We review the current knowledge of coextinction by: (i) considering plausible explanations for the discrepancy between predicted and observed coextinction rates; (ii) exploring the potential consequences of coextinctions; (iii) discussing the interactions and synergies between coextinction and other drivers of species loss, particularly climate change; and (iv) suggesting the way forward for understanding the phenomenon of coextinction, which may well be the most insidious threat to global biodiversity.

This study, over 2 years, examined homestead pond waters in the region for monthly dynamics and diversity of Aeromonas spp. The bacterial counts showed bi-modal annual growth peak, pre- and post-monsoon, strongly correlating (p < 0.0005) with temperature. Of 200 isolates characterized, Aeromonas veronii bv. sobria (27%) was predominant among co-existent Aeromonas schubertii (20%), Aeromonas hydrophila (17%), Aeromonas caviae (13%), and three more. PCR screening of virulence-related genes identified 15 genotypes (I to XV), however, enterotoxigenicity in animal model was observed for five genotypes, ca. 18% (nine of 50) strains, prevalent in A. veronii bv. sobria, A. hydrophila, and A. caviae. Pathogenic strains were distinguishable by possessing at least three of the major virulence genes: ascV, hlyA, ela, ast, and alt, together with accessory virulence factors. PFGE of XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed high genetic diversity and distant lineage of potentially toxigenic clones. Therefore, along with increased global warming, Aeromonas spp. having multi-factorial virulence potential in coastal ponds that serve as drinking water sources pose a potential health risk, and underscores the need for routine monitoring.

Climate change effects on airborne pathogenic bioaerosol concentrations: a scenario analysis	AEROBIOLOGIA				Article								The most recent IPCC report presented further scientific evidence for global climate change in the twenty-first century. Important secondary effects of climate change include those on water resource availability, agricultural yields, urban healthy living, biodiversity, ecosystems, food security, and public health. The aim of this explorative study was to determine the range of expected airborne pathogen concentrations during a single outbreak or release in a future climate compared to a historical climatic period (1981-2010). We used five climate scenarios for the periods 2016-2045 and 2036-2065 defined by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and two conversion tools to create hourly future meteorological data sets. We modelled season-averaged airborne pathogen concentrations by means of an atmospheric dispersion model and compared these data to historical (1981-2010) modelled concentrations. Our results showed that modelled concentrations were modified several percentage points on average as a result of climate change. On average, concentrations were reduced in four out of five scenarios. Wind speed and global radiation were of critical importance, which determine horizontal and vertical dilution. Modelled concentrations decreased on average, but large positive and negative hourly averaged effects were calculated (from -67 to +639 %). This explorative study shows that further research should include pathogen inactivation and more detailed probability functions on precipitation, snow, and large-scale circulation.	[van Leuken, J. P.

Baseline biodiversity assessment of South Texas small mammals and host-associated hard ticks with no detection of selected tick-borne pathogens	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST				Article								Baseline biodiversity surveys are necessary to assess organismal diversity across spatial and temporal scales. These surveys can be particularly useful for monitoring changes in organismal diversity and pathogen spread in response to climate change. Arthropod vectors such as ticks are susceptible to geographic range shifts with a warming climate, potentially resulting in the expansion of risk areas for vector-borne disease. Biodiversity data are deficient from South Texas, which is particularly concerning given the abundance of wildlife and livestock that may be important in perpetuating tick and pathogen populations. We performed a baseline biodiversity assessment of small mammals, ticks, and tick-borne pathogens in South Texas using a combination of fieldwork, collections-based research, and molecular approaches. We recorded 19 species of small mammals and 3 species of ticks, and we detected no tick-borne pathogens belonging to the genera Borrelia or Rickettsia in the ticks or mammals. Given the continued emergence of tick-borne disease, we recommend collaborations with natural history collections and private landowners interested in land stewardship so researchers can develop a better understanding of changing small mammal, tick, and pathogen diversity with implications for human and veterinary health in this region of Texas.

J	Abayomi, A; Cowan, MN				Abayomi, A.; Cowan, M. N.			The HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa: Convergence with tuberculosis, socioecological vulnerability, and climate change patterns	SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL				Article								Recent assessment reports suggest that climate change patterns are threatening social and ecological vulnerability and resilience, with the strong potential of negatively affecting human health. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water-and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a 'syndemic' with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent - from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming. However, global climate assessments assert that these are not sufficient to halt climate change patterns. The roles of regionally specific climate research, socioecologically sustainable industrialisation paths for developing countries, and adoption of health system strengthening strategies are therefore vital.

Within these forests, the understorey is an important biodiversity reservoir that can influence ecosystem processes and functions in multiple ways. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of the relative importance of the understorey for temperate forest functioning. As a result, understoreys are often ignored during assessments of forest functioning and changes thereof under global change. We here compiled studies that quantify the relative importance of the understorey for temperate forest functioning, focussing on litter production, nutrient cycling, evapotranspiration, tree regeneration, pollination and pathogen dynamics. We describe the mechanisms driving understorey functioning and develop a conceptual framework synthesizing possible effects of multiple global change drivers on understorey-mediated forest ecosystem functioning. Our review illustrates that the understorey's contribution to temperate forest functioning is significant but varies depending on the ecosystem function and the environmental context, and more importantly, the characteristics of the overstorey. To predict changes in understorey functioning and its relative importance for temperate forest functioning under global change, we argue that a simultaneous investigation of both overstorey and understorey functional responses to global change will be crucial. Our review shows that such studies are still very scarce, only available for a limited set of ecosystem functions and limited to quantification, providing little data to forecast functional responses to global change.

CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL				Review								Climate change is currently perceived as the most important challenge faced globally by ecosystems and human society. The predicted changes of temperature and precipitation patterns are expected to alter the environmental conditions to which forest trees in Europe are adapted, and expose them to new pests and pathogens.This would unavoidably lead to a huge loss of ecosystem services provided to society, and at the local scale may potentially endanger the very existence of forests. In this study, we reviewed biological background and limits of mechanisms by which tree populations may cope with climate change: adaptation by natural selection, gene flow, epigenetic phenomena and phenotypic plasticity, as well as forest management strategies, which rely on these mechanisms. We argue that maintaining genetic diversity is important in the long-term view but natural selection cannot ensure sufficiently rapid response to environmental change. On the other hand, epigenetic memory effects may change adaptively relevant traits within a single generation, while close-to-nature forestry practices are the basic requirement to make use of epigenetics. Assisted migration, as a frequently suggested mitigation option, relies primarily on the knowledge gained from provenance research; the review analyses potential pitfalls of this strategy. We suggest that all approaches, i.e., leaving a part of forests without management, close-to-nature forestry, and transfer of forest reproductive materials from sources presumably adapted to future climates are combined across the landscape in an integrative manner.

J	Allegra, V; Muratore, F; Zarba, AS				Allegra, Valeria; Muratore, Francesco; Zarba, Alfonso Silvio			THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINIBILITY OF THE AGRICULTURAL SOIL: FUMIGATION COSTS TREATMENTS IN THE CASE HORTICULTURE INTENSIVE IN GREENHOUSE	QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS				Article								From multiple researches whose aim was to achieve scientific results of the productive processes of Mediterranean agriculture which influences the climate change, emerges that the thematic of economic and environmental sustainability of intensive farming holds a particular interest. The branch of protected horticulture offers different research cues to deal with the problematic related to climate change. The issue revolves around the allocation of resources, or rather those means of production involved in the phenomenon of climate change. If the ground intended to be used for agriculture does not get worked on with an anaerobic lagoon, it might become a source of emission. In order to reach the fulfillment of sustainable agriculture, maintaining the biodiversity of the ground is highly important. The ground intended to be used for intensive horticultural farming is more exposed to damage. The main problematic, concerns the infestation of rook-knot nematodes. Considering the area of the Mediterranean basin, these pathogens are in fact mainly present in the Sicilian agricultural soil, especially if the latter is intended to be used for the cultivation of vegetables in a protected environment. The fight against terrestrial parasites through the fumigation acquires a significant importance in medium and long-term; in other words, with business aim (grounded on the income) and social aim (environmental). The cost of fumigation represents in fact a part of the cost of the horticultural cultivation production, which is of partial importance. This study reports the results of an survey of the fumigation cost of protected horticulture companies in Sicily. The economic and environmental suitability depends on these companies for the strategic choices of medium-term.

Elemental Ratios Link Environmental Change and Human Health	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Review								Humans have fundamentally altered the cycling of multiple elements on a global scale. These changes impact the structure and function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with many implications for human health. Most prior studies linking biogeochemical changes to human health have evaluated the effects of single elements in isolation. However, the relative availability of multiple elements often determines the biological impact of shifts in the concentration of a single element. The balance of multiple elements is the focus of ecological stoichiometry, which highlights the importance of elemental ratios in biological function across all systems and scales of organization. Consequently, ecological stoichiometry is a promising framework to inform research on the links between global changes to elemental cycles and human health. We synthesize evidence that elemental ratios link global change with human health through biological processes occurring at two scales: in the environment (natural ecosystems and food systems) and within the human body. Elemental ratios in the environment impact the key ecosystem processes of productivity and biodiversity, both of which contribute to the production of food, toxins, allergens, and parasites. Elemental ratios in diet impact processes within the human body, including the function and interactions of the immune system, parasites, and the non-pathogenic microbiome. Collectively, these stoichiometric effects contribute to a wide range of non-infectious and infectious diseases. By describing stoichiometric mechanisms linking global change, ecological processes, and human health, we hope to inspire future empirical and theoretical research on this theme.

This species has declined 40%-90% throughout its range owing to blister rust infection, mountain pine beetle, fire suppression, and global climate change. However, intact mature and old growth forests still exist in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) at high timberline elevations. This study addresses the urgent need to discover the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi critical to this tree species before forests are further reduced. A study of mature whitebark pine forests across five mountain ranges in the Northern GYE confirmed 32 ECM species of fungi with the pine by sporocarp occurrence in pure stands or by identification of mycorrhizae with ITS-matching. Boletales and Cortinariales (Cortinarius) comprise 50% of the species diversity discovered. In Boletales, Suillus subalpinus M.M. Moser (with stone pines), Suillus sibericus Singer (stone pines), Rhizopogon evadens A.H. Sm. (five-needle pines), Rhizopogon spp. (pines) and a semi-secotioid Chroogomphus sp. (pines) are restricted to the hosts listed and are not likely to occur with other high elevation conifers in the GYE. The ascomycete generalist, Cenococcum geophilum Fr., was the most frequent (64%) and abundant (51%) ECM fungus on seedling roots, as previously reported for high elevation spruce-fir and lower elevation lodgepole pine forests in the GYE. The relative importance of the basidiomycete specialists and the ascomycete generalist to whitebark pine (and for seedling establishment) is not known, however this study is the first step in delineating the ECM fungi associated with this pine in peril.

The ash dieback invasion of Europe was founded by two genetically divergent individuals	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION				Article								Accelerating international trade and climate change make pathogen spread an increasing concern. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, the causal agent of ash dieback, is a fungal pathogen that has been moving across continents and hosts from Asian to European ash. Most European common ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) are highly susceptible to H. fraxineus, although a minority (-5%) have partial resistance to dieback. Here, we assemble and annotate a H. fraxineus draft genome, which approaches chromosome scale. Pathogen genetic diversity across Europe and in Japan, reveals a strong bottleneck in Europe, though a signal of adaptive diversity remains in key host interaction genes. We find that the European population was founded by two divergent haploid individuals. Divergence between these haplotypes represents the ancestral polymorphism within a large source population. Subsequent introduction from this source would greatly increase adaptive potential of the pathogen. Thus, further introgression of H. fraxineus into Europe represents a potential threat and Europe-wide biological security measures are needed to manage this disease.

J	Rusek, J				Rusek, J			Biodiversity of Collembola and their functional role in the ecosystem	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				Article								More than 6500 species of Collembola are known from throughout the world and these an only a small part of the still undescribed species. There are many checklists and catalogues of Collembola for smaller territories and entire continents. Biogeographical analyses have been made for some genera and smaller territories. The most serious problems for a global biogeographical analysis is the lack of enough records from immense territories of all continents. Local biodiversity of Collembola can be very high, reaching over 100 species in small mountain ranges. Sampling methods do not impede documenting biodiversity on a global scale. Collembola have well differentiated ecomorphological life-forms and Feeding guilds which enable the functional role that Collembola play in ecosystems to be recognised in some degree. Collembola play an important role in plant litter decomposition processes and in forming soil microstructure. They are hosts of many parasitic Protozoa. Nematoda, Trematoda and pathogenic bacteria and in turn are attacked by different predators. They utilise as food Protozoa, Nematoda, Rotatoria, Enchytraeidae, invertebrate carrion, bacteria, fungi, algae, plant litter, live plant tissues, and some plant pathogens. Soil acidification, nitrogen supply, global climate change and intensive farming have greatly impacted collembolan diversity.

A worldwide survey of genome sequence variation provides insight into the evolutionary history of the honeybee Apis mellifera	NATURE GENETICS				Article								The honeybee Apis mellifera has major ecological and economic importance. We analyze patterns of genetic variation at 8.3 million SNPs, identified by sequencing 140 honeybee genomes from a worldwide sample of 14 populations at a combined total depth of 634x. These data provide insight into the evolutionary history and genetic basis of local adaptation in this species. We find evidence that population sizes have fluctuated greatly, mirroring historical fluctuations in climate, although contemporary populations have high genetic diversity, indicating the absence of domestication bottlenecks. Levels of genetic variation are strongly shaped by natural selection and are highly correlated with patterns of gene expression and DNA methylation. We identify genomic signatures of local adaptation, which are enriched in genes expressed in workers and in immune system and sperm motility related genes that might underlie geographic variation in reproduction, dispersal and disease resistance. This study provides a framework for future investigations into responses to pathogens and climate change in honeybees.

J	Martinez, J; Merino, S				Martinez, J.; Merino, S.			Host-parasite interactions under extreme climatic conditions	CURRENT ZOOLOGY				Article								The effect that climatic changes can exert on parasitic interactions represents a multifactor problem whose results are difficult to predict. The actual impact of changes will depend on their magnitude and the physiological tolerance of affected organisms. When the change is considered extreme (i.e. unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given area), the probability of an alteration in an organisms' homeostasis increases dramatically. However, factors determining the altered dynamics of host-parasite interactions due to an extreme change are the same as those acting in response to changes of lower magnitude. Only a deep knowledge of these factors will help to produce more accurate predictive models for the effects of extreme changes on parasitic interactions. Extreme environmental conditions may affect pathogens directly when they include free-living stages in their life-cycles and indirectly through reduced resource availability for hosts and thus reduced ability to produce efficient anti-parasite defenses, or by effects on host density affecting transmission dynamics of diseases or the frequency of intraspecific contact. What are the consequences for host-parasite interactions? Here we summarize the present knowledge on three principal factors in determining host-parasite associations; biodiversity, population density and immunocompetence. In addition, we analyzed examples of the effects of environmental alteration of anthropogenic origin on parasitic systems because the effects are analogous to that exerted by an extreme climatic change [Current Zoology 57 (3): 390-405, 2011].

In Japan, mass attacks of an ambrosia beetle, vectoring a pathogenic fungus, cause oak wilt outbreaks in recent decades. Here, the associa-tions of oak wilt and climate with wood-inhabiting fungal communities in apparently healthy Quercus serrata trunks were investigated using DNA metabarcoding in seven sites along a climatic gradient in Japan. Amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 region generated 1,339,958 sequence reads containing 879 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in 234 wood samples. OTU compositions were significantly different between sites with and without oak wilt. OTU richness increased with temperature and precipitation at sites where oak wilt was present, but this relationship was not observed at sites without oak wilt, possibly due to interaction between oak wilt and climate.

Novel allelic variation is needed to break the yield plateau, particularly in the face of climate change and rapidly evolving pests and pathogens. Landraces preserved in seed banks likely harbour valuable sources of untapped genetic diversity because they were cultivated for thousands of years under diverse eco-geographical conditions prior to modern breeding. We performed the first genetic characterisation of bread wheat accessions sourced from the N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) in St Petersburg, Russia. A panel comprising 295 accessions, including landraces, breeding lines and cultivars was subject to single seed descent (SSD) and genotyped using the genotyping-by-sequencing Diversity Arrays Technology platform (DArT-seq); returning a total of 34,311 polymorphic markers (14,228 mapped and 20,083 unmapped). Cluster analysis identified two distinct groups; one comprising mostly breeding lines and cultivars, and the other comprising landraces. Diversity was benchmarked in comparison to a set of standards, which revealed a high degree of genetic similarity among breeding material from Australia and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Further, 11,025 markers (1888 mapped and 9137 unmapped) were polymorphic in the diversity panel only, thus representing allelic diversity potentially not present in Australian or CIMMYT germplasm. Open-access to DArT-seq markers and seed for SSD lines will empower researchers, pre-breeders and breeders to rediscover genetic diversity in the VIR collection and accelerate utilisation of novel alleles to improve wheat.

Due to changing climatic conditions, ticks are assumed to be able to expand their ranges in Europe towards higher latitudes and altitudes, which could result in an increased occurrence of tick-borne diseases. There is a great interest to identify potential (new) areas of distribution of vector species in order to assess the future infection risk with vector-borne diseases, improve surveillance, to develop more targeted monitoring program, and, if required, control measures. Based on an ecological niche modelling approach we project the climatic suitability for the three tick species Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor reticulatus and Dermacentor marginatus under current and future climatic conditions in Europe. These common tick species also feed on humans and livestock and are vector competent for a number of pathogens. For niche modelling, we used a comprehensive occurrence data set based on several databases and publications and six bioclimatic variables in a maximum entropy approach. For projections, we used the most recent IPCC data on current and future climatic conditions including four different scenarios of socio-economic developments. Our models clearly support the assumption that the three tick species will benefit from climate change with projected range expansions towards north-eastern Europe and wide areas in central Europe with projected potential co-occurrence. A higher tick biodiversity and locally higher abundances might increase the risk of tick-borne diseases, although other factors such as pathogen prevalence and host abundances are also important.

Globalization's Implications for G20 Governance	VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS RESEARCH JOURNAL				Article								The rapid globalization of money, goods, services, taxation, knowledge, people, political ideas, digitalization, and especially pathogens and ecological pollutants has intensified, along with rising inequality, multipolarity, protectionism, isolationism and geopolitical tensions. Together these factors present new challenges to 21st century global governance led by the systemically significant states which make up the Group of Twenty (G20). G20 governance has expanded in response, but with more success on its old, incompletely globalized economic agenda than on its newer, more globalized digitalization, health pandemics and climate change agendas. The most recent G20 summit in Osaka, Japan on 28-29 June 2019 did make advances on tax and digitalization but not on the looming health risks and the existential threat of climate change. Preparations for the Saudi Arabian-hosted Riyadh summit, to be held on 21-22 November 2020, have made some progress on the latter amidst the unprecedented crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis shows that the G20's architecture needs to be further strengthened by institutionalizing G20 environment and health ministers' meetings; inviting the executive heads of the United Nations (UN) bodies for climate change, biodiversity, the environment and health, as well as the leaders of key outside countries, to the summits; giving the UN and World Health Organization the same G20 status as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank; and holding a second annual summit at the UN each September focused on the sustainable development goals.

J	Baynes, J; Neale, A; Hultgren, T				Baynes, Jeremy; Neale, Anne; Hultgren, Torrin			Improving intelligent dasymetric mapping population density estimates at 30 m resolution for the conterminous United States by excluding uninhabited areas	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA				Article; Data Paper								Population change impacts almost every aspect of global change from land use, to greenhouse gas emissions, to biodiversity conservation, to the spread of disease. Data on spatial patterns of population density help us understand patterns and drivers of human settlement and can help us quantify the exposure we face to natural disasters, pollution, and infectious disease. Human populations are typically recorded by national or regional units that can vary in shape and size. Using these irregularly sized units and ancillary data related to population dynamics, we can produce high-resolution gridded estimates of population density through intelligent dasymetric mapping (IDM). The gridded population density provides a more detailed estimate of how the population is distributed within larger units. Furthermore, we can refine our estimates of population density by specifying uninhabited areas which have impacts on the analysis of population density such as our estimates of human exposure. In this study, we used various geospatial datasets to expand the existing specification of uninhabited areas within the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) EnviroAtlas Dasymetric Population Map for the conterminous United States (CONUS). When compared to the existing definition of uninhabited areas for the EnviroAtlas dasymetric population map, we found that IDM's population estimates for the US Census Bureau blocks improved across all states in the CONUS. We found that IDM performed better in states with larger urban areas than in states that are sparsely populated. We also updated the existing EnviroAtlas Intelligent Dasymetric Mapping toolbox and expanded its capabilities to accept uninhabited areas. The updated 30m population density for the CONUS is available via the EPA's Environmental Dataset Gateway	[Baynes, Jeremy; Neale, Anne] US EPA, Ctr Publ Hlth & Environm Assessment, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA; [Hultgren, Torrin] US EPA, Natl Geospatial Support Team, ITS EPA III Infrastruct Support & Applicat Hostin, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA		Baynes, J (corresponding author), US EPA, Ctr Publ Hlth & Environm Assessment, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27711 USA.	baynes.jeremy@epa.gov								0	0											JUN 23	2022	14	6					2833	2849		10.5194/essd-14-2833-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2833-2022				Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences				36213148				2023-09-28	WOS:000814522900001

The major challenges are the sustainability of forest resources and the conservation of biological diversity. Due to climate change, an increase in the incidence of fires and the action of pathogens has been observed in recent years. The forestry sector in Portugal has a high economic, social, and environmental value. In economic 'Willis, in 2015, its gross value added (GVA) represented more than 10 billion euros, corresponding to 13% of industrial GVA and 3% of national gross domestic ABSTRACT The forestry sector in Portugal faces important challenges, resulting in an increased incidence of fires and the action of pathogens, which puts the sustainability of forest resources at risk. Due to the economic, social, and environmental importance of forests, this work assessed the land use environmental impact of maritime pine and eucalypt standing in Portuguese forests. SimaPro software was used to translate the inventory table results into land use impact category. The ILCD 2011 Midpoint+ method was chosen to assess the "land use" environmental impact that focuses on soil quality and its indicator (kg carbon deficit), which describes the changes in soil organic matter associated with land interventions. The results showed that for the first rotation time, the land use impact category per cubic meter of maritime pine is 18423 kg C deficit and 23430 kg C deficit for eucalypt, which means that the land use impact category of eucalypt is 27% higher than the impact of maritime pine.

J	Tripathi, L; Ntui, VO; Tripathi, JN				Tripathi, Leena; Ntui, Valentine Otang; Tripathi, Jaindra Nath			Application of genetic modification and genome editing for developing climate-smart banana	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY				Review								Banana is a major staple food crop feeding more than 500 million people in tropical and subtropical countries. Its production is largely constrained by diseases and pests in addition to other factors such as declining soil fertility, narrow genetic diversity in germplasm, and inadequate availability of clean planting material. The impact of climate change, particularly a rise in temperature and drought, is predicted to affect production adversely due to direct effect on plant agronomy and also influence on pathogens, pests, and their interactions with host plants. There is need to develop climate-smart varieties of banana with multiple and durable resistance to combat abiotic stresses such as extreme temperature and drought, and biotic stresses such as pathogens and pests. Modern breeding tools, including genetic modification and genome editing, can be applied for the improvement of banana bypassing the natural bottlenecks of traditional breeding. Intensive efforts using genetic modification have been made to develop improved banana varieties with resistance to biotic stresses; however, these need to be coupled with tolerance to abiotic stresses. Genome editing, an emerging powerful tool, can be applied for developing sustainable solutions to adapt to climate change by resisting biotic and abiotic stresses. CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has been lately established for banana, paving the way for functional genomics allowing identification of genes associated with stress-tolerant traits, which could be used for the improvement of banana for adaptation to a changing climate. This article presents an overview of recent advancements and prospective on the application of genetic modification and genome editing for developing climate-smart banana.

J	Hulme, PE				Hulme, Philip E.			Climate change and biological invasions: evidence, expectations, and response options	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				Article								A changing climate may directly or indirectly influence biological invasions by altering the likelihood of introduction or establishment, as well as modifying the geographic range, environmental impacts, economic costs or management of alien species. A comprehensive assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change.

There is clear evidence of recent declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel declines in the plants that rely upon them. Here we describe the nature and extent of reported declines, and review the potential drivers of pollinator loss, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop production, food security and human welfare.

The last great forest: a review of the status of invasive species in the North American boreal forest	FORESTRY				Review								The boreal forest is the world's largest terrestrial biome, covering all continents in the northern hemisphere. Much research has focused on the effects of forest management and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem level processes of the boreal forest. However, even though climate change and the increasing rate of resource exploitation are likely to intensify the arrival and establishment of exotic species with the potential to become invasive, the boreal forest continues to be viewed as inhospitable to incoming species and we have little understanding of its invasive species status. We reviewed the literature and compiled information on the current status of invasive species across all taxa present in the North American boreal forest. We found that an increasing number of exotic plants, insects, earthworms, slugs and pathogens are establishing in the boreal forest. Research is scarce and their ecological effects are poorly understood. However, given that some of the reported species represent a major driver of change in many ecosystems globally, we expect that this review will provide direction for invasive species research as well as preventative measures aimed at better understanding and conserving Earth's largest terrestrial biome.

Green revolution, however, achieved the targets of high food productivity, but at the cost of environmental degradation such as water pollution, soil contamination, climate change and biodiversity loss. Feeding the growing population and sustaining the quality of the environment are the two major challenges of Indian agriculture system. Traditional agricultural practices have been an integral part of food production in India since ages. These practices have the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change with spatial and sequential diversity. This review covers three aspects of traditional farming of India: cultivation, biological method of pest management and locally available sustainable practices of crop protection. Double cropping, mixed cropping, crop rotation, agroforestry, use of local varieties and resources with host-pathogen interaction are some of the prominent traditional agricultural practices in India which have to be strengthened in view of the environment and food security. Such practices have a significant role in achieving the sustainability of agriculture by improving nutrition quality. The overall objective of this article is to highlight the potential of these practices for the sustainability of environment and food production.

Historical species losses in bumblebee evolution	BIOLOGY LETTERS				Article								Investigating how species coped with past environmental changes informs how modern species might face human-induced global changes, notably via the study of historical extinction, a dominant feature that has shaped current biodiversity patterns. The genus Bombus, which comprises 250 mostly cold-adapted species, is an iconic insect group sensitive to current global changes. Through a combination of habitat loss, pathogens and climate change, bumblebees have experienced major population declines, and several species are threatened with extinction. Using a time-calibrated tree of Bombus, we analyse their diversification dynamics and test hypotheses about the role of extinction during major environmental changes in their evolutionary history. These analyses support a history of fluctuating species dynamics with two periods of historical species loss in bumblebees. Dating estimates gauge that one of these events started after the middle Miocene climatic optimum and one during the early Pliocene. Both periods are coincident with global climate change that may have extirpated Bombus species. Interestingly, bumblebees experienced high diversification rates during the Plio-Pleistocene glaciations. We also found evidence for a major species loss in the past one million years that may be continuing today.

His work was a landmark treatment of the European fauna and laid the groundwork for subsequent mammalogists. Miller's impressive body of specimen-based research underscores the fundamental role natural history collections have played in building our understanding of the natural world. Their relevance to basic discovery endures, as collections have evolved since Miller's time to include new materials (e.g., tissues, cell suspensions, linked host/parasites), and as new tools (e.g., genomic sequencing, stable isotopes, niche envelopes) for extracting information have developed exponentially. While still utilized for systematic and taxonomic questions, museums and associated web-based databases (GBIF, GenBank, GoogleEarth) are now critical to our ability to rigorously address questions related to environmental change (e.g., climate change, habitat conversion, emerging pathogens, pollutants and toxicants, biodiversity loss, introduction of exotics). Specimens are the primary resource that objectively documents diversity and vouchers historic conditions. By representing a particular site and time, georeferenced specimens establish critical baseline conditions against which temporal change can be investigated. As in Miller's day, museums remain centers for research and training as future generations of scientists are introduced to biodiversity studies.

In the debate on climate change driven changes in species selection in the forest, Norway maple has recently received raised interest because of its comparatively high drought resistance (higher than in sycamore maple). Therefore, it is an interesting species for sites high in carbonates and where other native tree species have become devastated by pathogens (e.g., elm, ash). In Austria, the demand on saplings is currently rising, while there is only very little domestic reproductive material available (on average more than 95% of saplings are imported from neighboring countries). This study was undertaken to identify genetic diversity and population structure of Norway maple in Austria to lay the foundation for the establishment of respective in situ and ex situ conservation measures. In addition, samples from planted stands and imported reproductive material from other countries were included to study the anthropogenic influence on the species in managed forests. We used 11 novel microsatellites to genotype 756 samples from 27 putatively natural Austrian populations, and 186 samples derived from two planted stands and five lots of forest reproductive material; in addition, 106 samples from other European populations were also genotyped. Cross species amplification of the new markers was tested in 19 Acer species from around the world. Population clustering by STRUCTURE analysis revealed a distinct pattern of population structure in Austria and Europe, but overall moderate differentiation. Sibship analysis identifies several populations with severe founding effects, highlighting the need for proper selection of seed sources of sufficient genetic diversity in the species.

Animals lose their natural habitats due to extensive landscape changes, consequently crowding them together and increasing their interaction with humans. Additionally, it is also important to emphasise the increasing concern on climate change because climate can modify the distribution and intensity of other diseases such as vector-borne disease. Unfortunately, the global resources for biodiversity conservation were diluted by government support for activities harmful to the environment. A tragic example is from the Amazon rainforest, that experienced fast environmental depletion and high social inequalities. Extractive systems and extensive land use on a large scale have induced deforestation, great loss of biodiversity, carbon emission, and water contamination, leading to indigenous land dispossession, violence, and rural-urban migration. The deforested areas in the Amazon region increase considerably at an alarming speed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic is an evidence to show how viruses and pathogens move further and faster than before, which means we must also show a quick response. It requires financing and, mostly, changes in human behaviour. The message is simple: we need to rethink our current relationship with nature and with ourselves, which should lead to a social transformation towards the sustainable use of the available resources.

Mitigating the Effects of Habitat Loss on Solitary Bees in Agricultural Ecosystems	AGRICULTURE-BASEL				Review								Solitary bees and other wild pollinators provide an important ecosystem service which can benefit both the agricultural economy and the sustainability of many native ecosystems. Many solitary bees, however, are experiencing decreases in their populations and ranges, resulting in an overall loss of pollinator species richness in many areas. Several interacting factors have been implicated in this decline, including increased pesticide use, climate change, and pathogens, but habitat loss remains one of the primary drivers. The widespread conversion of natural habitats into agricultural landscapes has decreased the availability of adequate nesting sites and floral diversity for many bee species. Large monocultures with intensive production systems often cannot support the populations of wild bees (particularly species with short foraging ranges) necessary to ensure adequate pollination of animal-pollinated crops. Diversifying agricultural landscapes through the incorporation of wildflower plantings, as well as the preservation of remaining natural habitats, may offer a solution, as it has been shown to increase both bee diversity and abundance and the pollination of nearby crops. In this review article, we discuss the various effects of habitat loss on solitary bees and different ways to mitigate such effects in order to conserve bee diversity and populations in agricultural landscapes.

The groundwater heat pumps (GWHP) system using groundwater is the most environmentally friendly system to date and has been examined in several studies. However, biological clogging by microorganisms negatively affects the thermal efficiency of the GWHP system. In this study, we employed air surging, the most popular among well management methods, and pyrosequencing to analyze the genetic diversity in bacteria before and after air surging in a geothermal well. Furthermore, the diversity of dominant bacterial genera and those related to clogging were evaluated. The bacterial diversity of the groundwater well increased after air surging. Nevertheless, the proportion of bacterial genera thought to be related to microbiological clogging decreased. In cooling and heating systems based on the geothermal energy of groundwater, the wells should be maintained regularly by air surging to reduce efficiency problems caused by microbiological clogging and to prevent secondary damage to human health, e.g., pneumonia due to human pathogenic bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter.

J	Liu, X; Rohr, JR; Li, YM				Liu, Xuan; Rohr, Jason R.; Li, Yiming			Climate, vegetation, introduced hosts and trade shape a global wildlife pandemic	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								Global factors, such as climate change, international trade and introductions of exotic species are often elicited as contributors to the unprecedented rate of disease emergence, but few studies have partitioned these factors for global pandemics. Although contemporary correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can be useful for predicting the spatial patterns of emerging diseases, they focus mainly on the fundamental niche (FN) predictors (i.e. abiotic climate and habitat factors), neglecting dispersal and propagule pressure predictors (PP, number of non-native individuals released into a region). Using a validated, predictive and global SDM, we show that both FN and PP accounted for significant, unique variation to the distribution of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen implicated in the declines and extinctions of over 200 amphibian species worldwide. Bd was associated positively with vegetation, total trade and introduced amphibian hosts, nonlinearly with annual temperature range and non-significantly with amphibian leg trade or amphibian species richness. These findings provide a rare example where both FN and PP factors are predictive of a global pandemic. Our model should help guide management of this deadly pathogen and the development of other globally predictive models for species invasions and pathogen emergence influenced by FN and PP factors.

J	Ennos, RA				Ennos, Richard A.			Resilience of forests to pathogens: an evolutionary ecology perspective	FORESTRY				Article								Both natural and managed forests are currently suffering from increases in damage by pathogens. Here, an evolutionary ecology approach is adopted to analyse the factors that influence the levels of pathogen damage experienced by forest tree populations and consider the conditions under which stable co-existence of trees and pathogens occurs in natural populations. The demographic and genetic responses of tree-pathogen systems to anthropogenic perturbations are explored to identify where the greatest threats to resilience lie. Problems caused by native pathogens are likely to arise as a consequence both of rapid climate change and of forest management practices that lead to increases in species density, drastic reductions in genetic diversity and planting outside the native range. The most serious threats to forest trees are posed by introduction of exotic pathogens derived from related exotic tree species. Recovery following spread of exotic pathogens is likely to be both slow and uncertain and may not be possible without intensive programmes involving rapid selection and widespread dissemination of genotypes resistant to the exotic pathogen.

In recent years, many pails of Europe have seen important changes in the nature of animal husbandry and parasite control, which have increased the need for a precise understanding of the current distribution and prevalence of livestock ectoparasites. In some cases, these changes have been associated with moves towards increased productivity, such as higher-stocking densities, large-scale rearing units, indoor confinement, reduced genetic diversity and large-scale movement of animals and, in others, with a move towards organic farming. There have also been changes in parasite control, associated with the development of new parasiticides, such as the macrocyclic lactones, and concern over the continued use of some of the older neurotoxic compounds. These changes have been exacerbated by outbreaks of endemic disease, the threats of exotic disease introduction and fears of potential changes in arthropod distribution associated with climate change. This paper therefore, reviews the current status of livestock ectoparasites in Europe and the Mediterranean region. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Parasite vulnerability to climate change: an evidence- based functional trait approach	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE				Review								Despite the number of virulent pathogens that are projected to benefit from global change and to spread in the next century, we suggest that a combination of coextinction risk and climate sensitivity could make parasites at least as extinction prone as any other trophic group. However, the existing interdisciplinary toolbox for identifying species threatened by climate change is inadequate or inappropriate when considering parasites as conservation targets. A functional trait approach can be used to connect parasites' ecological role to their risk of disappearance, but this is complicated by the taxonomic and functional diversity of many parasite clades. Here, we propose biological traits that may render parasite species particularly vulnerable to extinction (including high host specificity, complex life cycles and narrow climatic tolerance), and identify critical gaps in our knowledge of parasite biology and ecology. By doing so, we provide criteria to identify vulnerable parasite species and triage parasite conservation efforts.

J	Ehrenfeld, D				Ehrenfeld, D			The environmental limits to globalization	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY				Article								Criticisms of globalization have been largely based on its socioeconomic effects, but the environmental impacts of globalization are equally important. These include acceleration of climate change; drawdown of global stocks of cheap energy; substantial increases in air, water, and soil pollution; decreases in biodiversity, including a massive loss of crop and livestock varieties; depletion of ocean fisheries; and a significant increase in invasions of exotic species, including plant, animal, and human pathogens. Because of negative feedback from these changes, the future of globalization itself is bleak. The environmental and social problems inherent in globalization are completely interrelated - any attempt to treat them as separate entities is unlikely to succeed in easing the transition to a postglobalized world.

J	Gobbi, M; Isaia, M; De Bernardi, F				Gobbi, Mauro; Isaia, Marco; De Bernardi, Fiorenza			Arthropod colonisation of a debris-covered glacier	HOLOCENE				Article								The largest debris-covered glacier in the Alps (Miage Glacier, western Italian Alps) has been studied to explore the effects of debris-cover extent and depth on the spatial distribution of ground-dwelling arthropods. A multitaxa approach has been used to compare taxa richness and distribution to the functional role (dietary habits) of each taxon along the glacier tongue. Spiders and ground beetles have been studied in detail. Taxa richness declines with distance from the wooded sites (in front of the glacier tongue) to those above the glacier tongue. At each of the supraglacial sites, spiders, ground beetles, aphids, springtails and flies were found. A change in the dominance of the different functional roles was observed along the tongue. Wooded sites are characterised by predatory (e.g. spiders, beetles), detrivore (e.g. springtails and certain flies), phytophagous (e.g. aphids, certain beetles) and parasitoid (e.g. certain wasps) assemblages, whereas at the debris-covered sites, aphids, flies and springtails are likely to be prey for spiders and beetles. The species richness of the predominant predators (spiders and beetles) shows a positive relationship with vegetation cover and debris thickness. Two mutually exclusive spider and ground beetle assemblages were found; one within the debris cover and one within the wooded sites. In our opinion, debris-covered glaciers are acting as a refuge area for the cryophil stenotherm species living at higher altitudes which descend the glacial tongue to lower elevations. A similar hypothesis supports the biogeographical interpretation of the distribution of many boreo-alpine relict species in the Alps. We discuss our results in the light of possible future scenarios which suggest an increase in debris cover with global warming.

Ant biodiversity and ecosystem services in bioenergy landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT				Article								Most strategies for limiting global climate change invoke the use of bioenergy, but biofuel crops vary in climate mitigation potential and in the provision of other ecosystem services. The predominant biofuel in North America is ethanol produced from corn Zea mays. Corn is grown on similar to 360,000 km(2) of land in the U.S. and similar to 40 % of the yield is used for ethanol production. Despite its prevalence, corn ethanol is a poor climate change mitigator and the spread of intensive corn agriculture also leads to the loss of biodiversity and an unknown complement of associated ecosystem services. To test for effects of land use intensity on the provision of ecosystem services from biofuel crops, we compared insect communities inhabiting long-term experiments in which land use intensity varied from annual corn production to less intensive native perennial biofuel crops (switchgrass and restored prairie) and unmanaged native forests. Within the experiments we focused on ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera), including their diversity, abundance, functional traits, and predation of biofuel crop pests. Native perennial biofuel crops supported up to 185 % more ant species than corn fields and provided up to 55 % more natural pest suppression. They also contained higher functional richness by supporting social parasites and seed dispersing ants that were absent in corn. Biofuel crops did not differ in ant activity or the prevalence of introduced ants. Our results highlight tradeoffs in bioenergy production and suggest ways to maximize benefits for wildlife and people. Converting some corn fields to prairie or other native vegetation could restore landscapes while mitigating climate change and meeting energy needs.

The differential diagnosis of pathogenic Anaplasma phagocytophilum and non-pathogenic A. phagocytophilum-like Anaplasma spp. is important for implementing effective treatment from control programs. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in horses in Korea by nucleotide sequencing and restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism assay. Of the 627 horses included in the study, only 1 (0.2%) was infected with A. phagocytophilum. Co-infection with A. phagocytophilum-like Anaplasma spp. was not detected in the study. The 16S rRNA sequence of A. phagocytophilum was similar (99.5-100%) to A. phagocytophilum 16S rRNA isolated from horses in other countries. PCR adapted to amplify A. phagocytophilum groEL and msp2 genes failed to generate amplicons, suggesting genetic diversity in these genes. This study is the first molecular detection of A. phagocytophilum in horses in Korea. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis and animal infection of A. phagocytophilum have been reported in Korea recently. Because of vector tick distribution, global warming, and the increase of the horse industry, horses should be considered as a potential reservoir for A. phagocytophilum, and cross infectivity should be evaluated even though a low prevalence of infection was detected in this study. Furthermore, continuous surveillance and effective control measures for A. phagocytophilum should be established to prevent disease distribution and possible transmission to humans.

Plant responses to soil biota depend on precipitation history, plant diversity, and productivity	ECOLOGY				Article								Soil biota are critical drivers of plant growth, population dynamics, and community structure and thus have wide-ranging effects on ecosystem function. Interactions between plants and soil biota are complex, however, and can depend on the diversity and productivity of the plant community and environmental conditions. Plant-soil biota interactions may be especially important during stressful periods, such as drought, when plants can gain great benefits from beneficial biota but may be susceptible to antagonists. How soil biota respond to drought is also important and can influence plant growth following drought and leave legacies that affect future plant responses to soil biota and further drought. To explore how drought legacies and plant community context influence plant growth responses to soil biota and further drought, we collected soils from 12 grasslands varying in plant diversity and productivity where precipitation was experimentally reduced. We used these soils as inoculum in a growth chamber experiment testing how precipitation history (ambient or reduced) and soil biota (live or sterile soil inoculum) mediate plant growth and drought responses within an experimental plant community. We also tested whether these responses differed with the diversity and productivity of the community where the soil was collected. Plant growth responses to soil biota were positive when inoculated with soils from less diverse and productive plant communities and became negative as the diversity and productivity of the conditioning community increased. At low diversity, however, positive soil biota effects on plant growth were eliminated if precipitation had been reduced in the field, suggesting that diversity loss may heighten climate change sensitivity. Differences among species within the experimental community in their responses to soil biota and drought suggest that species benefitting from less drought sensitive soil biota may be able to compensate for some of this loss of productivity. Regardless of the plant species and soil origin, further drought eliminated any effects of soil biota on plant growth. Consequently, soil biota may be unable to buffer the effects of drought on primary productivity or other ecosystem functions as extreme events increase in frequency.

J	Salomon, OD; Quintana, MG; Mastrangelo, AV; Fernandez, MS				Daniel Salomon, Oscar; Gabriela Quintana, Maria; Veronica Mastrangelo, Andrea; Soledad Fernandez, Maria			Leishmaniasis and Climate Change-Case Study: Argentina	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE				Review								Vector-borne diseases closely associated with the environment, such as leishmaniases, have been a usual argument about the deleterious impact of climate change on public health. From the biological point of view interaction of different variables has different and even conflicting effects on the survival of vectors and the probability transmission of pathogens. The results on ecoepidemiology of leishmaniasis in Argentina related to climate variables at different scales of space and time are presented. These studies showed that the changes in transmission due to change or increase in frequency and intensity of climatic instability were expressed through changes in the probability of vector-human reservoir effective contacts. These changes of contact in turn are modulated by both direct effects on the biology and ecology of the organisms involved, as by perceptions and changes in the behavior of the human communities at risk. Therefore, from the perspective of public health and state policy, and taking into account the current nonlinear increased velocity of climate change, we concluded that discussing the uncertainties of large-scale models will have lower impact than to develop-validate mitigation strategies to be operative at local level, and compatibles with sustainable development, conservation biodiversity, and respect for cultural diversity.

J	Pukkala, T				Pukkala, Timo			Effect of species composition on ecosystem services in European boreal forest	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH				Article								Forest management in several boreal countries is strongly focused on conifers because they are more productive, the technical quality of their stems is better, and their wood fibers are longer as compared to broadleaves. Favoring conifers in forest management leads to simple forest structures with low resilience and diversity. Such forests are risky in the face of climate change and fluctuating timber prices. Climate change increases the vitality of many forest pests and pathogens such as Heterobasidion spp. and Ips typographus L. which attack mainly spruce. Wind damages are also increasing because of a shorter period of frozen soil to provide a firm anchorage against storms. Wind-thrown trees serve as starting points for bark beetle outbreaks. Increasing the proportion of broadleaved species might alleviate some of these problems. This study predicts the long-term (150 years) consequences of current conifer-oriented forest management in two forest areas, and compared this management with silvicultural strategies that promote mixed forests and broadleaved species. The results show that, in the absence of damages, conifer-oriented forestry would lead to 5-10% higher timber yields and carbon sequestration. The somewhat lower carbon sequestration of broadleaved forests was counteracted by their higher albedo (reflectance). Mixed and broadleaf forests were better providers of recreational amenities. Species diversity was much higher in mixed stand and broadleaf-oriented silviculture at stand and forest levels. The analysis indicates that conifer-oriented forest management produces rather small and uncertain economic benefits at a high cost in resilience and diversity.

J	Burkle, FM				Burkle, Frederick M.			Political Intrusions into the International Health Regulations Treaty and Its Impact on Management of Rapidly Emerging Zoonotic Pandemics: What History Tells Us	PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE				Article								For a large number of health care providers world-wide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is their first experience in population-based care. In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHO's singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management. As Osler recognized, his concept of "one medicine, one health" defines what global public health is today.

However, there is no spatially explicit and continuous rice-planting information in either country. This knowledge gap clearly hinders our ability to understand the effects of spatial paddy rice area dynamics on the environment, such as food and water security, climate change, and zoonotic infectious disease transmission. To resolve this problem, we first generated annual maps of paddy rice planting areas for both countries from 2000 to 2015, which are derived from time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the phenology- and pixel-based rice mapping platform (RICE-MODIS), and analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of paddy rice dynamics in the two countries. We found that China experienced a general decrease in paddy rice planting area with a rate of 0.72 million (m) ha/yr from 2000 to 2015, while a significant increase at a rate of 0.27 m ha/yr for the same time period happened in India. The spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in China shifted northeastward significantly, due to simultaneous expansions in paddy rice planting areas in northeastern China and contractions in southern China. India showed an expansion of paddy rice areas across the entire country, particularly in the northwestern region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain located in north India and the central and south plateau of India. In general, there has been a northwesterly shift in the spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in India. These changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice planting area have raised new concerns on how the shift may affect national food security and environmental issues relevant to water, climate, and biodiversity.

In the context of ongoing deforestation and agricultural intensification in the tropics secondary rainforest fragments might contribute to biodiversity conservation and mitigation of climate warming. This study investigated the interactive effects of habitat fragmentation and microclimate on the abundance and biotic interactions of trap-nesting bees and wasps in secondary forest fragments in the northwestern lowlands of Costa Rica. Fragment size did not affect hymenopteran abundance, parasitism and mortality rates, but all variables differed between edge and interior locations in the forest fragments. Interactive effects between size and location indicate higher mortality rates at interior locations in larger fragments. Microclimatic differences at edge and interior locations led to significant effects on all tested response variables. Abundance at interior locations was significantly higher with increasing temperatures. Mortality rates at interior location increased at lower mean temperatures, whereas higher temperatures at edges marginally increased mortality rates. Our results indicate that edge effects, mediated by altered microclimatic conditions, significantly change biotic interactions of trap-nesting hymenopterans in small secondary fragments.

Considering the importance of the highland Plateau of Mexico as part of the North American bird migratory route and as a region containing important habitat for numerous bird species, the purpose of this study was to document haemosporidian species richness and how habitat degradation, bird body condition, and distance from water sources correlate with bird parasitemia. Methods: We assessed the presence of avian haemosporidians in three resident bird species through microscopy and PCR amplification of a fragment of the haemosporidian cytochrome b gene. Average parasitemia was estimated in each species, and its relationship with habitat degradation through grazing, bird body condition and distance from water bodies was assessed. Results: High levels of parasitemia were recorded in two of the three bird species included in this study. Four lineages of haemosporidians were identified in the study area with nearly 50 % prevalence. Areas with highly degraded shrublands and villages showed higher parasitemia relative to areas with moderately degraded shrublands. No strong relationship between parasitemia and distance from water bodies was observed. There were no significant differences in prevalence and parasitemia between the two bird species infected with the parasites. Two of the sequences obtained from the fragments of the parasite's cytochrome b gene represent a lineage that had not been previously reported. Conclusions: Haemosporidian diversity in arid zones of the Mexican highland plateau is high. Shrubland habitat degradation associated to the establishment of small villages, as well as tree extraction and overgrazing in the surroundings of these villages, significantly enhances parasitemia of birds by haemosporidians.

They are also under considerable threat due to fragmentation degradation and urbanization. However, a complete understanding of how anthropogenic actions can affect microbial biodiversity and functional adaptations is still lacking. In this study, we carried out 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis using sediment samples from two distinct mangrove areas located within the Serinhaem Estuary, Brazil. The first sampling area was located around the urban area of Itubera, im-pacted by domestic sewage and urban runoff, while the second was an environmentally conserved site. Our results show significant changes in the structure of the communities between impacted and conserved sites. Biodiversity, along with functional potentials for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, were significantly increased in the urban area. We found that the environmental factors of organic matter, temperature and copper were significantly correlated with the observed shifts in the communities. Contributions of specific taxa to the functional potentials were negatively correlated with biodiversity, such that fewer numbers of taxa in the conserved area contributed to the majority of the metabolic potential. The results suggest that the contamination by urban runoff may have generated a different environment that led to the extinction of some taxa observed at the conserved site. In their place we found that the impacted site is enriched in prokaryotic families that are known human and animal pathogens, a clear negative effect of the urbanization process.

The case of the COVID-19 pandemic	GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY				Review								Non-technical summaryHumans have the tendency to damage the natural environment in many ways. Deforestation and conversion of forests for residential, industrial development, and expansion of agricultural crops, as well as the burning of fossil fuels, are some activities that disrupt natural ecosystems and wildlife and contribute to climate change. As a result, the life cycles of pathogens and intermediate hosts (insects, rodents, mammals) as well as biodiversity are affected. Through these activities, humans meet wild animals that transmit pathogens, resulting in their infection by zoonoses and causing epidemics-pandemics, the effects of which have as their final recipient himself and his activities. Technical summaryThis article aims to highlight the two-way relationship between those human activities and the occurrence of epidemics-pandemics. We will try to elaborate this two-way relationship, through the overview of the current pandemic (origin of SARS-CoV-2, modes of transmission, clinical picture of the disease of COVID-19, influence of weather and air pollution on prevalence and mortality, pandemic effects, and treatments). They are used as primary sources, scientific articles, literature, websites, and databases (Supplementary appendix) to analyze factors involved in the occurrence and transmission of zoonotic diseases in humans (Ebola, influenza, Lyme disease, dengue fever, cholera, AIDS/HIV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). The present paper concluded that humanity today faces two major challenges: controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the risk of a new global health crisis occurring in the future. The first can be achieved through equitable access to vaccines and treatments for all people. The second needs the global community to make a great change and start protecting the natural environment and its ecosystems through the adoption of prevention policies.

This effect can be modulated by environment conditions, such as soil nitrogen availability and air temperature. The ongoing global changes are altering these variables and thus interact with pathogens to influence plant biomass, but experimental test of their interactions is scarce. We conducted a 4-year field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow to examine the interactive effects of nitrogen addition, warming and foliar pathogens (via fungicide application) on plant biomass. We also measured plant functional traits, species richness and abundance to test the possible mechanisms underlying these interactions. Our results showed that foliar fungal pathogens reduced plant community biomass under nitrogen addition, which in turn weakened the positive nitrogen effect on community biomass. Mechanistically, nitrogen addition shifted the plant communities towards fast-growing traits; this happened predominantly because of changes in within-species trait values, including an increase in specific leaf area and height. These trait changes resulted in greater suppression of plant biomass by pathogens, likely because of the trade-offs associated with the allocation of resources to plant growth and defense. Moreover, the reduction in species richness amplified the pathogen effect under nitrogen addition due to the increased density and susceptibility of the most dominant species (i.e. Kobresia capillifolia). Furthermore, warming did not interact with pathogens and nitrogen addition to influence plant community biomass, but their three-way interaction modified the biomass of K. capillifolia. Specifically, warming enhanced the positive effect of nitrogen addition on the biomass of K. capillifolia in the fungicide, low infection plots, while it weakened the nitrogen effect in the no fungicide, high infection plots. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate how pathogens interact with nitrogen addition and warming to influence the biomass of dominant species and the whole plant community. Our study highlights the importance of considering foliar fungal pathogens when assessing ecosystem responses to multiple global change factors.

J	Johnson, PTJ; Thieltges, DW				Johnson, P. T. J.; Thieltges, D. W.			Diversity, decoys and the dilution effect: how ecological communities affect disease risk	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				Article								Growing interest in ecology has recently focused on the hypothesis that community diversity can mediate infection levels and disease ('dilution effect'). In turn, biodiversity loss - a widespread consequence of environmental change - can indirectly promote increases in disease, including those of medical and veterinary importance. While this work has focused primarily on correlational studies involving vector-borne microparasite diseases (e.g. Lyme disease, West Nile virus), we argue that parasites with complex life cycles (e.g. helminths, protists, myxosporeans and many fungi) offer an excellent additional model in which to experimentally address mechanistic questions underlying the dilution effect. Here, we unite recent ecological research on the dilution effect in microparasites with decades of parasitological research on the decoy effect in macroparasites to explore key questions surrounding the relationship between community structure and disease. We find consistent evidence that community diversity significantly alters parasite transmission and pathology under laboratory as well as natural conditions. Empirical examples and simple transmission models highlight the diversity of mechanisms through which such changes occur, typically involving predators, parasite decoys, low competency hosts or other parasites. However, the degree of transmission reduction varies among diluting species, parasite stage, and across spatial scales, challenging efforts to make quantitative, taxon-specific predictions about disease. Taken together, this synthesis highlights the broad link between community structure and disease while underscoring the importance of mitigating ongoing changes in biological communities owing to species introductions and extirpations.

Relationship between soil fungal diversity and temperature in the maritime Antarctic	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE				Article								Soil fungi have pivotal ecological roles as decomposers, pathogens and symbionts(1,2). Alterations to their diversity arising from climate change could have substantial effects on ecosystems, particularly those undergoing rapid warming that contain few species(3,4). Here, we report a study using pyrosequencing to assess fungal diversity in 29 soils sampled from a 1,650 km climatic gradient through the maritime Antarctic, the most rapidly warming region in the Southern Hemisphere(5,6). Using a 'space-for-time' substitution approach, we show that soil fungal diversity is higher in warmer habitats, with increases of 4.7 (observed) and 11.3 (predicted) fungal taxa per degree Celsius rise in surface temperature along the transect. Among 22 predictor variables, air temperature was the strongest and most consistent predictor of diversity. We propose that the current rapid warming in the maritime Antarctic (0.34 degrees C per decade(6)) will facilitate the colonization of soil by a wider diversity of fungi than at present, with data from regression models suggesting 20-27% increases in fungal species richness in the southern most soils by 2100. Such increases in diversity, which provide a sentinel for changes at lower latitudes, are likely to have substantial effects on nutrient cycling and, ultimately, productivity in the species-poor soils of maritime Antarctica.

Climate change and multitrophic interactions in soil: the primacy of plants and functional domains	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Review								Soil multitrophic interactions transfer energy from plants as the predominant primary producer to communities of organisms that occupy different positions in the food chain and are linked by multiple ecological networks, which is the soil food web. Soil food web sequesters carbon, cycles nutrients, maintains soil health to suppress pathogens, helps plants tolerate abiotic and biotic stress, and maintains ecosystem resilience and sustainability. Understanding the influence of climate change on soil multitrophic interactions is necessary to maintain these essential ecosystem services. But summarising this influence is a daunting task due to a paucity of knowledge and a lack of clarity on the ecological networks that constitute these interactions. The scant literature is fragmented along disciplinary lines, often reporting inconsistent findings that are context and scale-dependent. We argue for the differentiation of soil multitrophic interactions along functional and spatial domains to capture cross-disciplinary knowledge and mechanistically link all ecological networks to reproduce full functionalities of the soil food web. Distinct from litter mediated interactions in detritosphere or elsewhere in the soil, the proposed pathogen suppression and stress tolerance interactions operate in the rhizosphere. A review of the literature suggests that climate change will influence the relative importance, frequency and composition of functional groups, their trophic interactions and processes controlling these interactions. Specific climate change factors generally have a beneficial influence on pathogen suppression and stress tolerance, but findings on the overall soil food web are inconsistent due to a high level of uncertainty. In addition to an overall improvement in the understanding of soil multitrophic interactions using empirical and modelling approaches, we recommend linking biodiversity to function, understanding influence of combinations of climatic factors on multitrophic interactions and the evolutionary ecology of multitrophic interactions in a changing climate as areas that deserve most attention.

Current and future ozone risks to global terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem processes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Article								Risks associated with exposure of individual plant species to ozone (O-3) are well documented, but implications for terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem processes have received insufficient attention. This is an important gap because feedbacks to the atmosphere may change as future O-3 levels increase or decrease, depending on air quality and climate policies. Global simulation of O-3 using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) revealed that in 2000, about 40% of the Global 200 terrestrial ecoregions (ER) were exposed to O-3 above thresholds for ecological risks, with highest exposures in North America and Southern Europe, where there is field evidence of adverse effects of O-3, and in central Asia. Experimental studies show that O-3 can adversely affect the growth and flowering of plants and alter species composition and richness, although some communities can be resilient. Additional effects include changes in water flux regulation, pollination efficiency, and plant pathogen development. Recent research is unraveling a range of effects below-ground, including changes in soil invertebrates, plant litter quantity and quality, decomposition, and nutrient cycling and carbon pools. Changes are likely slow and may take decades to become detectable. CESM simulations for 2050 show that O-3 exposure under emission scenario RCP8.5 increases in all major biomes and that policies represented in scenario RCP4.5 do not lead to a general reduction in O-3 risks; rather, 50% of ERs still show an increase in exposure. Although a conceptual model is lacking to extrapolate documented effects to ERs with limited or no local information, and there is uncertainty about interactions with nitrogen input and climate change, the analysis suggests that in many ERs, O-3 risks will persist for biodiversity at different trophic levels, and for a range of ecosystem processes and feedbacks, which deserves more attention when assessing ecological implications of future atmospheric pollution and climate change.

The spread of invasive species and infectious disease as drivers of ecosystem change	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT				Review								Invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens affect biodiversity, ecosystem function and services, and human health. Climate change, land use, and transport vectors interact in complex ways to determine the spread of native and non-native invasive species, pathogens, and their effects on ecosystem dynamics. Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts. Understanding the interactions of invasive species, disease vectors, and pathogens with other drivers of ecosystem change is critical to human health and economic well-being.

As areas sensitive to climate change, they are critical for assessing the effects of global climate change. In China, grasslands account for over 40% of the land area. There is currently limited information on microbial diversity evolution in different grassland areas, particularly micro organisms with ice nucleation activity (INA) and their potential resources with potential influence to regulate regional precipitation and climate. We used Illumina MiSeq to sequence the 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable region and performed a simple droplet freezing experiment to determine the variation in the grassland microbial community species composition and community structure. Rainwater and topsoil samples from the Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia collected over three years were characterized. The dominant bacterial genus in the rainwater was Massilia, and the dominant fungus was Cladosporium. Additionally, the dominant bacteria in the soil were Sphingomonas, and the dominant fungus was Gibberella. There were differences in the microbial communities before and after the coronavirus disease epidemic. Pathogenic microorganisms exhibited inconsistent responses to environmental changes. The low relative abundance of known high-INA microorganisms and the higher freezing temperature indicated that unknown high-efficiency biological ice nucleating particles may be present. We found significant differences in species diversity and richness between the rainwater and soil populations in grassland areas by analyzing the sample community structures. Our research results revealed the species composition and structure of the microbiota in grassland ecosystems in China, indicating that environmental media and human activities may affect the microbiota in the grassland area and indicating underlying microorganisms with high INA.

J	Hancock, N; Gallagher, R				Hancock, Nola; Gallagher, Rachael			How ready are we to move species threatened from climate change? Insights into the assisted colonization debate from Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY				Article								Assisted colonization, the intentional movement of species beyond their native range, has been proposed as a climate change adaptation tool for biodiversity conservation. The risks and benefits of its implementation are still being debated but already the climate is changing, species are moving and the pressure on at-risk species must therefore be increasing. However, instances where moving species beyond their natural range purely for conservation purposes due to climate change are few, and the opportunity for science to inform practice is limited. Here we survey active participants in flora translocations and/or flora conservation in Australia in order to investigate the gap between theoretical and conceptual ideas about assisted colonization and to gauge preparedness for its implementation. We found that actions that mitigate proximal threats are preferred over those that move species beyond their current range. A lack of knowledge of species biology and ecology is an impediment to the acceptance of assisted colonization. In addition, prohibitive costs and the potential increased risk of the spread of diseases, pests and/or pathogens are viewed as more important obstacles of successful assisted colonization than potential for invasion at the recipient site. Full approval from all stakeholders at the source and recipient sites was found to be the most important factor for the successful assisted colonization of flora.

Helminth Parasites of the Pelophylax esculentus Complex (Anura: Ranidae) in Hortobagy National Park (Hungary)	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY				Article								The Document, Assess, Monitoring, Act (DAMA) protocol details an approach to integrating information about parasites into large-scale studies of biodiversity, climate change, and emerging diseases. This study represents an effort to put the DAMA protocol into practice. We collected 101 individuals of protected ranid frogs belonging to the Pelophylax esculentus complex during 2012 and 2013 in the Hortobagy National Park (HNP) in eastern Hungary in an area where an inventory of amphibian helminths had been conducted 40 yr previously. Collecting sites included flowing water, a fish pond system, and a wetland marsh system. We found the following helminth species: Digeneans: Diplodiscus subclavatus, Haematoloechus variegatus, Opisthioglyphe ranae, Pleurogenes claviger, Pleurogenoides medians; Nematodes: Oswaldo-cruzia filiformis, Rhabdias esculentarum; and Acanthocephala: Acanthocephalus ranae. Rhabdais esculentarum is a new species for the Hungarian fauna and P. ridibundus represents a new host record for R. esculentarum while D. subclavatus, P. claviger, and P. medians are new species for the helminthofauna of the HNP. Our findings showed a significant discrepancy from the results of baseline inventories carried out 40 yr ago, although the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. We suspect that the previously reported helminth species that we did not encounter are restricted to Pelophylax lessonae, a host we have not yet collected at this location, but factors associated with climate change or anthropogenic impacts cannot be ruled out.

Arctic marine phytobenthos of northern Baffin Island	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY				Article								Global climate change is expected to alter the polar bioregions faster than any other marine environment. This study assesses the biodiversity of seaweeds and associated eukaryotic pathogens of an established study site in northern Baffin Island (72 degrees N), providing a baseline inventory for future work assessing impacts of the currently ongoing changes in the Arctic marine environment. A total of 33 Phaeophyceae, 24 Rhodophyceae, 2 Chlorophyceae, 12 Ulvophyceae, 1 Trebouxiophyceae, and 1 Dinophyceae are reported, based on collections of an expedition to the area in 2009, complemented by unpublished records of Robert T. Wilce and the first-ever photographic documentation of the phytobenthos of the American Arctic. Molecular barcoding of isolates raised from incubated substratum samples revealed the presence of 20 species of brown seaweeds, including gametophytes of kelp and of a previously unsequenced Desmarestia closely related to D.viridis, two species of Pylaiella, the kelp endophyte Laminariocolax aecidioides and 11 previously unsequenced species of the Ectocarpales, highlighting the necessity to include molecular techniques for fully unraveling cryptic algal diversity. This study also includes the first records of Eurychasma dicksonii, a eukaryotic pathogen affecting seaweeds, from the American Arctic. Overall, this study provides both the most accurate inventory of seaweed diversity of the northern Baffin Island region to date and can be used as an important basis to understand diversity changes with climate change.

We propose a framework that allows comparison of consecutive stages that such novel organisms go through. The framework provides a common terminology for novel organisms, facilitating knowledge exchange among researchers, managers, and policy makers that work on, or have to make effective decisions about, novel organisms. The framework also indicates that knowledge about the causes and consequences of stage transitions for the better studied novel organisms, such as invasive species, can be transferred to more poorly studied ones, such as GMOs and emerging pathogens. Finally, the framework advances understanding of how climate change can affect the establishment, spread, and impacts of novel organisms, and how biodiversity affects, and is affected by, novel organisms.

Roughly, half of all hantaviruses cause diseases in humans that vary in morbidity from mild to severe. The natural and anthropogenic changes occurring in the environment appear to be impacting the ecology of hantaviruses and their natural hosts as well as the incidence of hantaviral diseases in humans. Although such studies are limited at this time, there is evidence that natural climate cycles such as El Nino as well as anthropogenic climate change enhance hantavirus prevalence when host population dynamics are driven by food availability. Climate appears to have less of an effect on hantavirus when host populations are controlled by predators. Human alteration to the landscape also appears to enhance hantavirus prevalence when the disturbance regime enriches the environment for the host, for example, agriculture. More long-term studies on multiple species of hantavirus are needed to accurately predict the outcome of changing environmental conditions on prevalence in hosts as well as disease incidence in humans.

In tropical regions, native plants depend heavily on stingless bees as pollinators since before the introduction of the European honey bee Apis mellifera. However, like for many other insect species worldwide, anthropogenic actions represent a true threat to stingless bee populations. In this article, we review the works that evaluated the potential negative impacts of human activities on populations of stingless bees. The studies constitute a strong body of evidence that stingless bee populations are at risk of decline around the world due to threats including habitat loss, agrochemicals, competition for resources, climate change, and the introduction of exotic species, including pathogens.

The ecological drivers of oil palm pollination are still poorly understood, despite pollination being a key ecosystem service for the yield of this multi-billion-dollar industry, with potential links to biodiversity conservation. Here we review biotic and abiotic drivers of pollination and known oil palm pollinators, including local insect species endemic to specific growing regions, and an important, globally-introduced West African weevil (Elaeidobius kamerunicus) whose fluctuating populations have led to concerns about yield and resilience. Future research should clarify pollinator community dynamics to facilitate pollination complementarity, which may strengthen pollination services in regions beyond the oil palm and weevil's native West African ecosystem. In addition, other interactions such as mutualism, predation, and parasitism are not yet well understood, but could provide further insight into population drivers. Future management research should explore manipulating male palm inflorescence density, a key resource for pollinators, as well as investigate spatial and landscape effects on pollinator populations. Critically, no studies have investigated the effects of climate change on pollination, despite the impacts of rain and temperature on pollination efficiency. A greater understanding of the role of pollinator species and their nonlinear relationships to yield, as well as the complexity of biotic, management, and climate drivers of successful pollination can contribute to a more sustainable oil palm production system that values ecosystem services gained from biodiversity, while also improving producer livelihoods.

J	Ayres, MP; Lombardero, MJ				Ayres, MP; Lombardero, MJ			Assessing the consequences of global change for forest disturbance from herbivores and pathogens	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				Review								Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed $1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.

J	Okamura, B; Feist, SW				Okamura, Beth; Feist, Stephen W.			Emerging diseases in freshwater systems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				Article								P>1. Emerging diseases in marine and terrestrial systems have been the subject of several high-profile syntheses but there are no such overviews of emerging diseases in fresh waters. The distinct differences associated with fresh waters merit the separate consideration given to freshwater emerging diseases in this Special Issue. 2. Unique aspects of freshwater environments that can be expected to influence disease emergence include the following: the extreme levels of environmental degradation, overfishing and biodiversity loss arising from preferential human settlement near freshwater bodies for millenia; their relatively small volume and the attraction of animal aggregations that promote disease transmission; and their role as arteries linking terrestrial and marine environments. 3. Understanding emerging diseases entails addressing the multiple drivers that influence the dynamics of host-parasite interactions in a changing world. Structural and functional transformations of ecosystems caused by overfishing may act as an important underlying driver. 4. Climate change may promote disease emergence, but environmental change may cause some diseases to diminish as a result of changes in distributions and abundances of hosts and disease agents. Furthermore, rapid evolution may constrain disease emergence despite environmental change. 5. Appreciating that parasites and pathogens are functional components of healthy ecosystems and that their dynamics may even portend ecosystem change would foster a more complete and balanced view of the value of biodiversity and the ecological role of disease. 6. A multidisciplinary approach will enable a better understanding of disease ecology in general and of freshwater emerging diseases as manifestations of host-parasite interactions to a specific range of conditions.

J	Aguirre, AA; Gomez, A				Aguirre, A. A.; Gomez, A.			Essential veterinary education in conservation medicine and ecosystem health: a global perspective	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				Article								Conservation medicine is an emerging discipline that links human and animal health with ecosystem health and global environmental change. The biosphere is threatened by several pervasive and synergistic phenomena that are the result of increasing human pressures on the planet: climate change, biological impoverishment (loss of biodiversity and ecological processes), emerging infectious diseases ('pathogen pollution') and global 'toxification' (pollutants such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals). These factors are working in concert to diminish human, domestic animal, wildlife and environmental health on this planet. By including conservation medicine and ecosystem health into veterinary curricula worldwide we can train young veterinarians that will help change paradigms and be able to form transdisciplinary teams. These veterinary professionals will develop new tools for assessing and monitoring ecological health and will be prepared to fulfil critical roles in sustaining global ecological health.	[Aguirre, A.

J	Latta, SC				Latta, Steven C.			Avian research in the Caribbean: past contributions and current priorities	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY				Review								The islands of the Caribbean contain habitat of critical importance to a large number of endemic and resident birds, as well as many overwintering Neotropical migrants, and they rank as a globally outstanding conservation priority ecoregion and biodiversity hotspot. Considerable research from the region has focused on the ecology of permanent resident species, and these studies have had particular significance for threatened species management, especially parrot biology and conservation, but also for tropical community ecology in general. Work by ornithologists in the Caribbean has been instrumental in improving our understanding of the ecology of overwintering Neotropical migrants and in developing long-term monitoring programs. Although Caribbean-based studies of birds have resulted in significant contributions in many important areas of ecological research, there is a great need for additional research. Especially needed are studies with application to the management of resident species, and studies of how bird populations may be affected by pathogens, parasites, plants, and other types of biotic interactions. Studies focusing on how bird species and populations are affected by global climate change, and cumulative, landscape-level changes in land use are also needed. Along with additional research, scientists have an important role to play in building capacity to prepare the next generation of biologists in the region who will need to address mounting challenges related to biodiversity protection. As with many conservation efforts, funding is a critical need for almost all organizations and agencies involved in research, conservation action, and capacity building in the West Indies.

The genetic conservation of tree species is an urgent global necessity as forest conversion and fragmentation continue apace, damaging insects and pathogens are transported between continents, and climate change alters local habitat suitability. Effective and efficient genetic conservation of tree species presents a substantial challenge because of the lack of basic information about many species, inadequate resources, and a historical lack of coordination within and between conservation sectors. Several cooperative efforts are already under way and are achieving conservation success, but much work remains. The Gene Conservation of Tree Species-Banking on the Future workshop in 2016 enabled the exchange of information and the creation of collaborations among tree conservation stakeholders. Several key themes emerged during the meeting's presentations and dialogue, which are further explored in this paper. In situ conservation of species is the long-term goal and is often the most efficient approach for preserving the genetic diversity of many forest tree species. Whether existing reserves adequately protect species and are sufficient for future conservation needs is uncertain. Ex situ conservation is an important complement to in situ efforts, acting as an insurance measure against extinction, providing material for restoration, enabling additional research opportunities, and educating the public. Networks of botanic gardens, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations must continue to coordinate ex situ and in situ efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tree conservation efforts. Assessing and prioritizing which species and populations require genetic conservation and prioritizing among them is a critical need. Two key tree restoration needs are for wider dissemination of planting stock, particularly stock with resistance to insects and pathogens, and for specific silvicultural prescriptions that facilitate restoration efforts. Effective genetic conservation of forest trees will require ongoing cooperation among widely diverse groups of scientists, managers, and policymakers from the public and private sectors.

Soil nematodes are good indicators of climate change and are considered to be one of the important driving forces for the succession of plant communities. Therefore, understanding the relationship between soil nematodes and aboveground communities is particularly important under long-term warming. We selected an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and conducted a long-term artificial warming experiment with five different gradients. We found that both plant and soil nematode community composition were affected by long-term warming. In addition, plant diversity and community composition profoundly affect the diversity of soil nematode communities, thus reflecting the dynamic processes and evolution of soil ecosystems. Global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issues today. Our study aimed to investigate how warming affected plant and soil nematode communities in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau over the past seven years. An artificial warming experiment with different gradients was conducted from 2011 to 2018, including temperature increases of 0 degrees C (CK), 0.53 degrees C (A), 1.15 degrees C (B), 2.07 degrees C (C), and 2.17 degrees C (D), respectively. Cyperaceae plants were shown to be eliminated by increasing temperature, and plant community composition tended to cluster differently under different warming gradients. The number of nematodes decreased with the increase in soil depth, and the majority of them were observed in the topsoil layer. The individual densities of soil nematodes were 197 ind.center dot 100 g(-1) dry soil at 10-20 cm and 188 ind.center dot 100 g(-1) dry soil at 20-30 cm in the A treatment, which was significantly higher than the CK (53 and 67 ind.center dot 100 g(-1) dry soil) (p < 0.05). The lowest relative abundance of bacterivore nematodes (Ba) was 31.31% in treatment A and reached the highest of 47.14% under the warming gradient of D (p < 0.05). The abundance of plant parasitic nematodes (Pp) was significantly reduced to 26.03% by excessive warming (2.17 degrees C increase) in comparison to CK (41.65%). The soil nematode community had the highest diversity with a 0.53 degrees C increase in soil temperature; 1.15 degrees C warming gradients were lower, and nematode communities tended to be simplified (p < 0.05). All nematode channel ratio (NCR) values were above 0.5, indicating that warming did not change the decomposition pathway of soil organic matter dominated by the bacterial channels. The Wasilewska Index (WI) in the D treatment increased significantly compared to other treatments (p < 0.05), indicating that the mineralized pathway of the food web was primarily involved with Ba and fungivores nematodes (Fu), which is conducive to the growth of micro-biophagous nematodes. The plant parasite index (PPI) decreased significantly in the D treatment compared with other treatments (p < 0.05), indicating that a high warming gradient caused a reduction in the maturity of Pp nematodes. The maturity index (MI) increased in the D treatment compared with A, B, and C treatments, indicating that overheating affected the nematode community in the later stage of succession and caused the soil to be less disturbed. A partial least squares path model (PLSPM) showed that warming indirectly affects Fu and Pp diversity by directly impacting the plant community as well as indirectly affecting Ba by directly affecting soil properties. In conclusion, plant diversity and community composition profoundly affect the soil nematode communities, thus reflecting the dynamic processes and evolution of soil ecosystems.

Ecto- and endoparasitic nematodes respond differently across sites to changes in precipitation	OECOLOGIA				Article								Plant parasitic nematodes are among the greatest consumers of primary production in terrestrial ecosystems. Their feeding strategies can be divided into endoparasites and ectoparasites that differ substantially, not only in their damage potential to host tissue and primary production, but also in their susceptibility to environmental changes. Climate change is predicted to increase variability of precipitation in many systems, yet the effects on belowground biodiversity and associated impacts on primary productivity remain poorly understood. To examine the impact of altered precipitation on endo- and ectoparasitic soil nematodes, we conducted a 2-year precipitation manipulation study across an arid, a semiarid, and a mesic grassland. Plant parasite feeding type abundance, functional guilds, and herbivory index in response to precipitation were evaluated. Responses of endo- and ectoparasites to increased precipitation varied by grassland type. There was little response of ectoparasites to increased precipitation although their population declined at the mesic site with increased precipitation. The abundance of endoparasites remained unchanged with increasing precipitation at the arid site, increased at the semiarid, and decreased at the mesic site. The herbivory index followed closely the trends seen in the endoparasites response by stagnating at the arid site, increasing at the semiarid, and decreasing at the mesic site. Our findings suggest that altered precipitation has differing effects on plant parasite feeding strategies as well as functional guilds. This may have important implications for grassland productivity, as plant parasite pressure may exacerbate the effects of climate change on host plants.	[Ankrom, Katharine E.; Franco, Andre L.

In a first phase starting in 1997, the biodiversity of insecticide-free and insecticide-treated parts of the vineyard was determined for several taxa. In a second phase starting 2004, entomological problems were addressed on an ad hoc basis as they unfolded. For example, at the request of viticulturists, research was conducted on the tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris-Miridae) and on the system phytoplasmas/cicadellids/grapevines. In a third phase starting in 2014, management of plants between grapevine rows and areas adjacent to the vineyard was carried out to increase biodiversity with the aim to achieve arthropod control with minimal insecticide and acaricide use. To address the advent of a new pest, such as the Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica-Scarabaeidae), a biocontrol program based on the parasite Istocheta aldrichi (Tachinidae) was initiated. In Quebec (Canada), viticulture has experienced steady growth in the last 35 years in terms of surfaces cultivated and value, although it is practiced in climatic conditions at the edge of what is considered a cool-climate area. This case study documents biodiversity studies conducted at the l'Orpailleur vineyard (Dunham, QC, Canada) from 1997 to 2021. In a first phase starting in 1997, the biodiversity of insecticide-free and insecticide-treated plots was determined for the taxa Scarabaeidae, Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cicadellidae, Acari and Aranae. This step provided a baseline allowing to identify key arthropods. In a second phase starting in 2004, entomological issues were addressed on an ad hoc basis. In 2014, a third phase began with a perspective of sustainability and management of plant diversity in the vineyard to conserve natural enemies. Because of increased Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica-Scarabaeidae) populations and threats to vineyards, a biocontrol program based on the parasitoid Istocheta aldrichi (Tachinidae) was initiated. The unusually fast development of grapevines during the growing season, selection of flowering species, as well as selected arthropods associated with these flowering species, will be illustrated. Periodic update of protection programs will be required to address future challenges associated with climate change scenarios and world trade.

Conservation physiology and the COVID-19 pandemic	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY				Article								The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures have had unanticipated effects on ecosystems and biodiversity. Conservation physiology and its mechanistic underpinnings are well positioned to generate robust data to inform the extent to which the Anthropause has benefited biodiversity through alterations in disturbance-, pollution- and climate change-related emissions. The conservation physiology toolbox includes sensitive biomarkers and tools that can be used both retroactively (e.g. to reconstruct stress in wildlife before, during and after lockdown measures) and proactively (e.g. future viral waves) to understand the physiological consequences of the pandemic. The pandemic has also created new risks to ecosystems and biodiversity through extensive use of various antimicrobial products (e.g. hand cleansers, sprays) and plastic medical waste. Conservation physiology can be used to identify regulatory thresholds for those products. Moreover, given that COVID-19 is zoonotic, there is also opportunity for conservation physiologists to work closely with experts in conservation medicine and human health on strategies that will reduce the likelihood of future pandemics (e.g. what conditions enable disease development and pathogen transfer) while embracing the One Health concept. The conservation physiology community has also been impacted directly by COVID-19 with interruptions in research, training and networking (e.g. conferences). Because this is a nascent discipline, it will be particularly important to support early career researchers and ensure that there are recruitment pathways for the next generation of conservation physiologists while creating a diverse and inclusive community. We remain hopeful for the future and in particular the ability of the conservation physiology community to deliver relevant, solutions-oriented science to guide decision makers particularly during the important post-COVID transition and economic recovery.

Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly coming to realize that parasites and pathogens, like free-living organisms, evolve as the consequence of these anthropogenic changes. Although this area now commands the attention of a variety of researchers, a broad predictive framework is lacking, mainly because the links between human activities, the environment and parasite evolution are complex. From empirical and theoretical examples chosen in the literature, we give an overview of the ways in which humans can directly or indirectly influence the evolution of different traits in parasites (e.g. specificity, virulence, polymorphism). We discuss the role of direct and indirect factors as diverse as habitat fragmentation, pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change, introduction of species, use of vaccines and antibiotics, ageing of the population, etc. We also present challenging questions for further research. Understanding the links between anthropogenic changes and parasite evolution needs to become a cornerstone of public health planning, economic development and conservation biology.

M.; Linder, Shelley D.; Fanning, Philip; Isaacs, Rufus; Szucs, Marianna			Experimental adaptation of native parasitoids to the invasive insect pest, Drosophila suzukii	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				Article								The spread of invasive pests is increasing due to greater global transportation and climate change-mediated range shifts. In a new community, these invasive species provide a novel resource that native predators or parasitoids can evolve to utilise. For invasive agricultural pests, this could provide top-down control; however, initial attack rates on invasive species in the wild are generally low. The potential for rapid adaptive evolution of native species to improve developmental success on invasive species is unknown. We address this by focusing on Drosophila suzukii, a polyphagous invasive pest, and two cosmopolitan Drosophila parasitoids found in North America prior to the arrival of D. suzukii (Pachycrepoideus vindemiae and Trichopria drosophilae). We experimentally evolved three replicate populations of both species on D. suzukii and the cosmopolitan D. melanogaster, a common host for both parasitoids. We found evidence that P. vindemiae increased developmental success by 88% (95% credible intervals = [-14%, 254%]) and T. drosophilae increased developmental success by 259% [38%, 711%] on D. suzukii after only three generations of selection, despite very low founding sizes of 2 and 30 wasps, respectively. These results demonstrate that rapid evolution of increased virulence is possible even from low genetic diversity, with implications for integrating evolutionary techniques into biological control of invasive species.

Biancardi, E; Panella, LW; Lewellen, RT		The Future	BETA MARITMA: THE ORIGIN OF BEETS				Article; Book Chapter								We have seen that over the past 60 years our knowledge of Beta maritima has grown tremendously. Its importance as a genetic resource in the breeding of sugar beet and other cultivated beet crops has become recognized. Nonetheless, only in the last 30 years has there been a coordinated effort to conserve sea beet germplasm. The international database for Beta lists more than 11,500 Beta/Patellifolia accessions in 33 gene banks worldwide. Many accessions likely are cultivated beets, but a substantial number are B. maritima. However, because species evolution no longer takes place in an ex situ gene bank collection, there is no further adaptation to their natural environment. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in providing in situ conservation of beet wild relatives in general, and B. maritima in particular. If the concerns with growing genetically modified sugar beet can be satisfied, the potential is large, but even so sea beet provides a reservoir of genetic resources to continue the battle against pest and pathogens of cultivated beet. Whatever the effects of global climate change may prove to be, it is likely that the superior genetic diversity in sea beet will provide the genetic traits necessary to maintain the performance of our crop plants in a changing environment.

Aquatic fungi are critical and abundant components of nutrient cycling and food web dynamics, e.g., exerting top-down control on phytoplankton communities and forming symbioses with many marine microorganisms. However, their relevance for microphytobenthic communities is almost unexplored. In the light of global warming, polar regions face extreme changes in abiotic factors with a severe impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, this study aimed to describe, for the first time, fungal diversity in Antarctic benthic habitats along the salinity gradient and to determine the co-occurrence of fungal parasites with their algal hosts, which were dominated by benthic diatoms. Our results reveal that Ascomycota and Chytridiomycota are the most abundant fungal taxa in these habitats. We show that also in Antarctic waters, salinity has a major impact on shaping not just fungal but rather the whole eukaryotic community composition, with a diversity of aquatic fungi increasing as salinity decreases. Moreover, we determined correlations between putative fungal parasites and potential benthic diatom hosts, highlighting the need for further systematic analysis of fungal diversity along with studies on taxonomy and ecological roles of Chytridiomycota.

Using the Ocean Health Index to Identify Opportunities and Challenges to Improving Southern Ocean Ecosystem Health	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE				Article								The Antarctic coast and seas are considered some of the most pristine marine systems on Earth. Their comprehensive assessment is critical because meeting ambitious conservation objectives while maintaining sustainable human uses will be increasingly challenging with growing climate change impacts, recovery from past overharvesting, and potential revision of activities permitted with future revisions of the existing governance structure. We used the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to deliver an integrated assessment of the Antarctic marine ecosystems' evolving ecological and social dimensions. The OHI provides a framework to evaluate sustainable delivery of benefits people want from healthy oceans by measuring progress toward 10 widely-held societal goals. These goals include, conservation objectives, as well as other objectives, so as to identify tradeoffs across multiple priorities. We adapted the Index to the unique aspects and data availability of Antarctica. OHI scores were calculated for each sub-region defined by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) as well as the region overall. OHI scores for conservation related goals (biodiversity, clean water) were generally high, though with some stressor impacts (i.e., climate-driven decline of sea-ice, and pathogen pollution). However, a sensitivity test on the sea-ice habitat indicator showed biodiversity scores might be much lower in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. Preservation of lasting special places, captured in the sense of place sub-goal, scored relatively low due to limited extent of Marine Protected Areas in the Southern Ocean. In several cases, scores are low due to under-utilization of resources, rather than environmentally unsustainable practices (e.g., food provision, natural products, tourism, and recreation). However, increased human activities would intensify the risk of pollution, pathogen contamination, and disturbance to wildlife, particularly if compounded with future climate change impacts. Therefore, scores may reflect the need to select more conservative targets for human use, articulated in international treaties, taking future risks into account. Our results highlight the need for more research on both natural and social science aspects of the Antarctic system, as well as the need to evaluate targets under different scenarios, so as to provide robust science-based advice for future decision-making in the region.

LINKING SOIL BIODIVERSITY AND VEGETATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR A CHANGING PLANET	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY				Article								Soil biota are intimately tied to plant communities through herbivory and symbiosis and indirectly by the decomposition of dead organic plant material. Through both roots and aboveground organic material (e. g., leaves and wood), plants provide substantial inputs of organic matter to soil systems. Plants are the basis for most biotic soil food webs that comprise an enormous diversity of species whose multiple interactions function to help regulate nutrient cycling, which in turn influences plant growth. Many factors govern the biogeography of soil biota, including the physical and chemical properties of soil, climate, the composition and type of vegetation, and interactions with other soil biota. Despite awareness of factors influencing soil communities, no single factor allows predictions of soil animal diversity or distribution. However, research is showing that plants can have unique soil biotic communities. Degradation of soil, which removes predators and biotic regulation that occurs in less managed ecosystems, can result in increased pathogens and pests that affect humans, other animals and plants. Global changes such as land use, desertification, and soil pollution all have been shown to alter soil animal diversity and abundance. Because of our dependence on soils and plant production, studies linking soil biotic communities to primary productivity are needed to assure long-term soil sustainability.

As a result, cork oak forests become susceptible to pest attack, which accelerates the onset of decline. Pest management strategies for this valuable and highly biodiverse ecosystem are examined in this review, taking into account the main insect pests and how their impact on cork oak forests is affected by climate change. While monitoring pests may provide the tools to predict the transition from endemic to epidemic insect populations, forestry practices (sanitary felling), biological control, and trapping are some of the most promising measures in protecting cork oak forests. - Context Over the last decades, cork oak (Quercus suber L.) decline has affected millions of trees throughout its distribution range. Cork oak is a typically Mediterranean species remarkably relevant for the biodiversity and landscape conservation of vast evergreen oak forests. Cork oak is also well known and highly valued for cork production. Climatic changes, management practices, and biotic factors, particularly plant pathogens and insect pests, play a decisive role in tree death and market devaluation of cork. - Aims Here, we review the major insect pests possibly involved in cork oak decline, while discussing pest management strategies. - Methods A survey of the current literature was performed to identify major insect pests affecting cork oak trees, as well as to establish the most promising pest management strategies under climate change. - Results Many authors seem to agree that the decline is triggered by both anthropogenic and abiotic factors, such as the mismanagement of cork oak forests and unfavorable climate (high temperatures and droughts). Consequently, trees become susceptible to pests and pathogens, which accelerate the onset of decline. - Conclusion Since a further increase in temperatures and droughts is expected, developing adequate management strategies to adapt cork oak trees to climate change, while simultaneously preventing and reducing insect pest attacks, is of foremost importance in the effort to conserve these unique and highly diverse ecosystems.

J	Loehle, C; Idso, C; Wigley, TB				Loehle, Craig; Idso, Craig; Wigley, T. Bently			Physiological and ecological factors influencing recent trends in United States forest health responses to climate change	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				Review								The health of United States forests is of concern for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, forest commercial values, and other reasons. Climate change, rising concentrations of CO2 and some pollutants could plausibly have affected forest health and growth rates over the past 150 years and may affect forests in the future. Multiple factors must be considered when assessing present and future forest health. Factors undergoing change include temperature, precipitation (including flood and drought), CO2 concentration, N deposition, and air pollutants. Secondary effects include alteration of pest and pathogen dynamics by climate change. We provide a review of these factors as they relate to forest health and climate change. We find that plants can shift their optimum temperature for photosynthesis, especially in the presence of elevated CO2, which also increases plant productivity. No clear national trend to date has been reported for flood or drought or their effects on forests except for a current drought in the US Southwest. Additionally, elevated CO2 increases water use efficiency and protects plants from drought. Pollutants can reduce plant growth but concentrations of major pollutants such as ozone have declined modestly. Ozone damage in particular is lessened by rising CO2. No clear trend has been reported for pathogen or insect damage but experiments suggest that in many cases rising CO2 enhances plant resistance to both agents. There is strong evidence from the United States and globally that forest growth has been increasing over recent decades to the past 100+ years. Future prospects for forests are not clear because different models produce divergent forecasts. However, forest growth models that incorporate more realistic physiological responses to rising CO2 are more likely to show future enhanced growth. Overall, our review suggests that United States forest health has improved over recent decades and is not likely to be impaired in at least the next few decades. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cacao agroforestry in Belize: Effects on soil nematode community structure	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS				Article								Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is a shade tolerant crop that can be grown beneath the rainforest canopy rather than in a conventional monoculture. Cacao agroforestry has been proposed as a more sustainable method of farming to mitigate climate change and protect above-ground biodiversity, yet impacts on soil biodiversity and function have rarely been investigated. Our goal was to study how the diversity and community structure of soil nematodes are impacted by planting the rainforest understory with cacao. At field sites in southern Belize and during two growing seasons, nematodes were extracted from soil from cacao agroforestry plots, undisturbed rainforests, and a banana plantation. Nematodes were enumerated and visually identified, and communities were analyzed using several community and diversity indices. In both the dry and wet seasons, soils from cacao plots contained similar nematode communities to the rainforest with respect to all measured variables, including the abundance of nematodes from each trophic group, the Bongers Maturity and Plant-Parasite indices, and the Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices. In contrast, the banana plantation soils were dominated by plant-parasitic nematodes with lower Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices. Overall, it appears that cacao agroforestry plots maintain nematode community structure relative to the undisturbed rainforest they were created from, suggesting that soil health is not compromised by this land-use strategy.

Traditional surveys of vertebrate fauna involve time-consuming and skill-demanding field methods. Recently, the use of DNA derived from invertebrate parasites (leeches and blowflies) was suggested as a new tool for vertebrate diversity assessment. Bloodmeal analyses of arthropod disease vectors have long been performed to describe their feeding behaviour, for epidemiological purposes. On the other hand, this existing expertise has not yet been applied to investigate vertebrate fauna per se. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of hematophagous dipterans as vertebrate samplers. Blood-fed sand flies and mosquitoes were collected in Amazonian forest sites and analysed using high-throughput sequencing of short mitochondrial markers. Bloodmeal identifications highlighted contrasting ecological features and feeding behaviour among dipteran species, which allowed unveiling arboreal and terrestrial mammals of various body size, as well as birds, lizards and amphibians. Additionally, lower vertebrate diversity was found in sites undergoing higher levels of human-induced perturbation. These results suggest that, in addition to providing precious information on disease vector host use, dipteran bloodmeal analyses may represent a useful tool in the study of vertebrate communities. Although further effort is required to validate the approach and consider its application to large-scale studies, this first work opens up promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and eco-epidemiology.

The Critical Need for Integrating Natural History Collections in Infectious Disease Studies	MBIO				Review								Despite being nearly 10 months into the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, the definitive animal host for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causal agent of COVID-19, remains unknown. Unfortunately, similar problems exist for other betacoronaviruses, and no vouchered specimens exist to corroborate host species identification for most of these pathogens. This most basic information is critical to the full understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonotic diseases. To overcome this hurdle, we recommend that host-pathogen researchers adopt vouchering practices and collaborate with natural history collections to permanently archive microbiological samples and host specimens. Vouchered specimens and associated samples provide both repeatability and extension to host-pathogen studies, and using them mobilizes a large workforce (i.e., biodiversity scientists) to assist in pandemic preparedness. We review several well-known examples that successfully integrate host pathogen research with natural history collections (e.g., yellow fever, hantaviruses, helminths). However, vouchering remains an underutilized practice in such studies. Using an online survey, we assessed vouchering practices used by microbiologists (e.g., bacteriologists, parasitologists, virologists) in host-pathogen research. A much greater number of respondents permanently archive microbiological samples than archive host specimens, and less than half of respondents voucher host specimens from which microbiological samples were lethally collected. To foster collaborations between microbiologists and natural history collections, we provide recommendations for integrating vouchering techniques and archiving of microbiological samples into host-pathogen studies. This integrative approach exemplifies the premise underlying One Health initiatives, providing critical infrastructure for addressing related issues ranging from public health to global climate change and the biodiversity crisis.

Using a biovigilance approach for pest and disease management in Quebec vineyards	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY				Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Biovigilance - A Framework for Effective Pest Management held during the Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Phytopathological-Society	JUN, 2016	Moncton, CANADA					Biovigilance can be defined as the study of the unintentional effects of various factors on pest (insects, pathogens, and weeds) populations, biodiversity and ecological services. Biovigilance research allows for the detection of significant temporal and spatial trends that may be linked to agricultural practices, new plant protection products, cultivars grown, new crops, climate change, or emerging and new pests. Since the 1950s, farming and pest management practices have undergone considerable changes driven notably by increased mechanization, intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides, and genetic improvement of crops. These practices have exerted pressure on pest populations, which have adapted by, among other means, developing pesticide resistance and overcoming crop resistance. In addition, climate change and the movement of plant products between different areas or countries also influence the diversity of pest populations and their natural enemies. As a result, pest management decisions must take into account these changes. Biovigilance-based information can be used for strategic (long-term) decisions about matters such as the type of production system, crop rotation, and host genetic selection for perennial crops. Similarly, knowledge on pest aggressiveness or pesticide resistance should be considered when making tactical (short-term) disease management decisions. Ultimately, biovigilance provides frameworks to address the increasing complexity of plant protection. The ultimate objective of biovigilance-based pest management is to mitigate potential threats before they become important problems. Typically, this approach to pest management is forward-looking and requires a long-term commitment for research. Viticulture in eastern Canada illustrates how biovigilance information can help to make optimal pest management decisions.	[Carisse, O.; Fall, M.

Control of crop diseases through Integrated Crop Management to deliver climate-smart farming systems for low- and high-input crop production	PLANT PATHOLOGY				Review								Crop diseases affect crop yield and quality and cause significant losses of total food production worldwide. With the ever-increasing world population and decreasing land and water resources, there is a need not only to produce more food but also to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change and avoid land use change and biodiversity loss. Thus, alternative climate-smart farming systems need to adapt to produce more food per hectare in a more sustainable way than conventional high-input farming systems. In addition to breeding new high-yielding cultivars adapted to future climates, there is a need to deploy Integrated Crop Management (ICM) strategies, relying less on synthetic inputs for fertilization and crop protection and less on fossil fuel-powered machinery to decrease yield losses due to pest and pathogens and guarantee food security. In this review, we compare some low-input farming systems to conventional agricultural systems with a focus on ICM solutions being developed to reduce synthetic inputs; these include crop genetic resistance to pathogens, intercropping, canopy architecture manipulation, and crop rotation. These techniques have potential to decrease crop disease frequency and severity by decreasing amounts and dispersal of pathogen inoculum and by producing microclimates that are less favourable for pathogen development, while decreasing GHG emissions and improving environmental sustainability. More research is needed to determine the best deployment of these ICM strategies in various cropping systems to maximize yield, crop protection, and other ecosystem services to address trade-offs between climate change and food security.

Food web structure changes with elevation but not rainforest stratum	ECOGRAPHY				Article								Changes in species richness along elevational gradients are well documented. However, little is known about how trophic interactions between species and, in particular, the food webs that these interactions comprise, change with elevation. Here we present results for the first comparison of quantitative food webs in forest understorey and canopy along an elevational gradient. Replicate quantitative food webs were constructed for assemblages involving 23 species of cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and 12 species of their parasitoids and kleptoparasites in subtropical rainforest in Australia. A total of 1589 insects were collected using trap nests across 20 plots distributed at sites ranging from 300 to 1100 m a.s.l. Insect abundance, insect diversity and parasitism rate generally decreased with increasing elevation. Food web structure significantly changed with elevation. In particular, weighted quantitative measures of linkage density, interaction evenness, nestedness (weighted NODF) and potential for enemy mediated interactions (PAC) decreased with increasing elevation, and network specialisation (H-2) increased with increasing elevation, even after controlling for matrix size; but there was no change in weighted connectance. Changes in forest type and temperature along the elevational gradient are likely to be, at least partly, responsible for the patterns observed. We found no significant differences in insect abundance, insect diversity or parasitism rate between canopy and understorey. Furthermore, there were no differences in food web structure between strata. These results contribute further evidence to studies revealing changes in food web structure along natural environmental gradients and provide information that can potentially be used for predicting how communities may respond to climate change.

We need to recognize the combined impact of these biotic and abiotic factors on species interactions, community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, the strength of predator-prey interactions often depends on the presence of other natural enemies: it weakens with competition and interference or strengthens with facilitation. Such effects of multiple predators on prey are likely to be affected by changes in the abiotic environment, altering top-down control, a key structuring force in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Here, we investigated how warming alters the effects of multiple predators on prey suppression using a dynamic model coupled with empirical laboratory experiments with Drosophila-parasitoid communities. While multiple parasitoids enhanced top-down control under warming, parasitoid performance generally declined when another parasitoid was present owing to competitive interactions. This could reduce top-down control over multiple generations. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for interactive effects between abiotic and biotic factors to better predict community dynamics in a rapidly changing world and thus better preserve ecosystem functioning and services such as biological control.

General decline in the diversity of the airborne microbiota under future climatic scenarios	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				Article								Microorganisms attached to aerosols can travel intercontinental distances, survive, and further colonize remote environments. Airborne microbes are influenced by environmental and climatic patterns that are predicted to change in the near future, with unknown consequences. We developed a new predictive method that dynamically addressed the temporal evolution of biodiversity in response to environmental covariates, linked to future climatic scenarios of the IPCC (AR5). We fitted these models against a 7-year monitoring of airborne microbes, collected in wet depositions. We found that Bacteria were more influenced by climatic variables than by aerosols sources, while the opposite was detected for Eukarya. Also, model simulations showed a general decline in bacterial richness, idiosyncratic responses of Eukarya, and changes in seasonality, with higher intensity within the worst-case climatic scenario (RCP 8.5). Additionally, the model predicted lower richness for airborne potential eukaryotic (fungi) pathogens of plants and humans. Our work pioneers on the potential effects of environmental variability on the airborne microbiome under the uncertain context of climate change.

Agricultural Innovations to Reduce the Health Impacts of Dams	SUSTAINABILITY				Article								Dams enable the production of food and renewable energy, making them a crucial tool for both economic development and climate change adaptation in low- and middle-income countries. However, dams may also disrupt traditional livelihood systems and increase the transmission of vector- and water-borne pathogens. These livelihood and health impacts diminish the benefits of dams to rural populations dependent on rivers, as hydrological and ecological alterations change flood regimes, reduce nutrient transport and lead to the loss of biodiversity. We propose four agricultural innovations for promoting equity, health, sustainable development, and climate resilience in dammed watersheds: (1) restoring migratory aquatic species, (2) removing submerged vegetation and transforming it into an agricultural resource, (3) restoring environmental flows and (4) integrating agriculture and aquaculture. As investment in dams accelerates in low- and middle-income countries, appropriately addressing their livelihood and health impacts can improve the sustainability of modern agriculture and economic development in a changing climate.

The conservation of many noncharismatic species is hampered by the lack of data. Yet, natural history research-a major source of information on noncharismatic species-is in decline. We here suggest a remedy for many mammal species, i.e., metagenomic clean-up of fecal samples that are "crowdsourced" during routine field surveys. Based on literature data, we estimate that this approach could yield natural history information for circa 1,000 species within a decade. Metagenomic analysis would simultaneously yield natural history data on diet and gut parasites while enhancing our understanding of host genetics, gut microbiome, and the functional interactions between traditional and new natural history data. We document the power of this approach by carrying out a "metagenomic clean-up" on fecal samples collected during a single night of small mammal trapping in one of Alfred Wallace's favorite collecting sites.

J	Lafferty, KD				Lafferty, Kevin D.			PARASITES IN MARINE FOOD WEBS	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE				Article								Most species interactions probably involve parasites. This review considers the extent to which marine ecologists should consider parasites to fully understand marine communities. Parasites are influential parts of food webs in estuaries, temperate reefs, and coral reefs, but their ecological importance is seldom recognized. Though difficult to observe, parasites can have substantial biomass, and they can be just as common as free-living consumers after controlling for body mass and trophic level. Parasites have direct impacts on the energetics of their hosts and some affect host behaviors, with ecosystem-level consequences. Although they cause disease, parasites are sensitive components of ecosystems. In particular, they suffer secondary extinctions due to biodiversity loss. Some parasites can also return to a system after habitat restoration. For these reasons, parasites can make good indicators of ecosystem integrity. Fishing can indirectly increase or decrease parasite populations and the effects of climate change on parasites are likely to be equally as complex.

However, obtaining good quality planting material is a major challenge. Multiplication rates are low, with expensive seeds and prone to contamination by pests and pathogens in traditional production systems. In addition, the intensive use of natural resources has caused impacts on biodiversity, quality of natural resources and global warming, which forces farmers to mitigate and adapt to these conditions. In this sense, the present study evaluated the response of apical cuttings of white yam to different levels of shading (0 %, 65 % and 80 %) and to the inoculation of the rhizobacterium Bacillus licheniformis-DSC1 at doses of 2 and 6 mL. A randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement and three replications was used to set up the experiment. The results demonstrated the capacity of the rhizobacterium B. licheniformis-DSC1 to increase the survival of the cuttings by 42 % with respect to the non-inoculated cuttings. It was also shown that the combined use of 65 % shade and a dose of 2 mL of rhizobacteria increased the percentage of tuberization of the cuttings by 33.33 %. The use of cuttings and microbial inoculants for seed tubers is a promising and sustainable strategy to be implemented on a large scale.

After two earlier papers investigating Tranosema rostrale and Meteorus trachynotus, this last article concerns the tachinid fly Actia interrupta (Diptera: Tachinidae). An individual-based model of the seasonal biology of A. interrupta was developed to determine the impact of climate on its interactions with two of its hosts, the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and the obliquebanded leafroller C. rosaceana in eastern North America. The model is based on the developmental responses of 'the parasitoid's successive life stages and the ovipositional response of adult females to temperature. It was found that the number of generations this parasitoid undergoes each year varies geographically from two to four, and that its potential growth rate, as dictated by synchrony with larvae of its overwintering host C. rosaceana, is highly patterned geographically and topographically as a result of phenological matching with larvae of obliquebanded leafroller entering diapause in late summer.

One of these species is the former European malaria vector, Anopheles atroparvus. Levels of population differentiation of An. atroparvus from southern Europe were characterized as a first attempt to elucidate patterns of population structure of this former malaria vector. Results are discussed in light of a hypothetical situation of re-establishment of malaria transmission. Methods: Genetic and phenotypic variation was analysed in nine mosquito samples collected from five European countries, using eight microsatellite loci and geometric morphometrics on 21 wing landmarks. Results: Levels of genetic diversity were comparable to those reported for tropical malaria vectors. Low levels of genetic (0.004 < F-ST < 0.086) and phenotypic differentiation were detected among An. atroparvus populations spanning over 3,000 km distance. Genetic differentiation (0.202 < F-ST < 0.299) was higher between the sibling species An. atroparvus and Anopheles maculipennis s.s. Differentiation between sibling species was not so evident at the phenotype level. Conclusions: Levels of population differentiation within An. atroparvus were low and not correlated with geographic distance or with putative physical barriers to gene flow (Alps and Pyrenees). While these results may suggest considerable levels of gene flow, other explanations such as the effect of historical population perturbations can also be hypothesized.

J	Phillips, BL; Brown, GP; Shine, R				Phillips, Benjamin L.; Brown, Gregory P.; Shine, Richard			Life-history evolution in range-shifting populations	ECOLOGY				Article								Most evolutionary theory does not deal with populations expanding or contracting in space. Invasive species, climate change, epidemics, and the breakdown of dispersal barriers, however, all create populations in this kind of spatial disequilibrium. Importantly, spatial disequilibrium can have important ecological and evolutionary outcomes. During continuous range expansion, for example, populations on the expanding front experience novel evolutionary pressures because frontal populations are assorted by dispersal ability and have a lower density of conspecifics than do core populations. These conditions favor the evolution of traits that increase rates of dispersal and reproduction. Additionally, lowered density on the expanding front eventually frees populations on the expanding edge from specialist, coevolved enemies, permitting higher investment into traits associated with dispersal and reproduction rather than defense against pathogens. As a result, the process of range expansion drives rapid life-history evolution, and this seems to occur despite ongoing serial founder events that have complex effects on genetic diversity at the expanding front. Traits evolving on the expanding edge are smeared across the landscape as the front moves through, leaving an ephemeral signature of range expansion in the life-history traits of a species across its newly colonized range. Recent studies suggest that such nonequilibrium processes during recent population history may have contributed to many patterns usually ascribed to evolutionary forces acting in populations at spatial equilibrium.

Population genetic analysis informs the invasion history of the emerging trematode &ITDicrocoelium dendriticum&IT into Canada	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				Article								Parasite distributions are constantly changing due to climate change, local and global movement of animals and humans, as well as land use and habitat change. The trematode Dicrocoelium dendriticum is a relatively recent invader of Canada, being first reported in eastern Canada in the 1930s and western Canada in the 1970s. However, historical records are scarce and its emergence is poorly understood. The establishment of this parasite in Canada provides an interesting opportunity to explore the use of population genetic approaches to help elucidate the invasion history of a relatively recently established helminth parasite. In this study, we compare the genetic diversity and population structure of a number of D. dendriticum populations from western and eastern Canada, and compare these with much longer established European populations. Two independent genetic marker systems were used; a microsatellite marker panel and a cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequence marker. We found distinct differences in both genetic diversity and population structure of the different Canadian populations that provide insights into their invasion histories compared with the European populations. Two populations from British Columbia, Canada - Salt Spring and Vancouver Islands - are of low diversity, show evidence of a population bottleneck and are closely related to each other, suggesting a shared recent history of establishment. These west coast populations are otherwise most closely related to those from eastern Canada and western Europe, and in contrast are genetically divergent from those in Cypress Hills, Alberta, Canada. Although the Alberta parasite population is the most recently reported in Canada, being first identified there in the early 1990s, it was the most genetically diverse of those examined and showed a strong pattern of admixture of genotypes present in western and eastern Europe. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which western Europe is likely the source of flukes on the east coast of Canada, which were then subsequently translocated to the west coast of Canada. The most recently reported D. dendriticum population in Canada appears to have a different history and likely has multiple origins. (C) 2017 Australian Society for Parasitology.

J	Mody, K; Spoerndli, C; Dorn, S				Mody, Karsten; Spoerndli, Charlotte; Dorn, Silvia			Within-orchard variability of the ecosystem service 'parasitism': Effects of cultivars, ants and tree location	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY				Article								Insect-mediated ecosystem services such as biological pest control contribute to sustainable agriculture. Local-scale factors are of high relevance to farmers striving for enhanced conservation biological control. However, particularly in perennial cropping systems, knowledge is limited on which and how local factors affect the effectiveness of parasitoids as natural enemies of pests. Focussing on parasitism of the apple blossom weevil Anthonomus pomorum by native parasitic wasps in fruit orchards adjacent to forests, we quantified the effects of the following potential determinants of the ecosystem service 'parasitism': (1) apple cultivar, (2) presence of ants, (3) distance between apple trees and forest (edge effects), and (4) environmental variability (temperature and precipitation patterns in five study years; orchard clearcut as a fundamental change in land-use). Apple cultivars varied significantly in flowering phenology and blossom size. Parasitism of A. pomorum by hymenopteran parasitoids differed consistently among apple cultivars across years. Weevil infestation of trees was also significantly affected by apple cultivar. Ant exclusion from apple trees significantly increased parasitism in one apple cultivar. Parasitism was higher on potted phytometer trees close to forest than on those distant from forest. Parasitism differed significantly among study years. Across-year parasitism levels were more similar for overall parasitism than for parasitism by the key parasitoid, the ichneumonid Scambus pomorum alone. Parasitism on potted trees remained high for the two years following orchard clearcut, whereas weevil infestation was significantly reduced in the second year after clearcut. This study shows that local-scale factors including crop cultivar, presence of ants that act as antagonists of parasitoids, and within-field position of crop plants may affect the ecosystem service of parasitism, and hence can be applied to improve natural pest control. Parasitoid diversity may stabilize parasitism levels, depending on actual environmental conditions.

J	Blaustein, AR; Kiesecker, JM				Blaustein, AR; Kiesecker, JM			Complexity in conservation: lessons from the global decline of amphibian populations	ECOLOGY LETTERS				Review								As part of an overall "biodiversity crisis" many amphibian populations are in decline throughout the world. Numerous causes have been invoked to explain these declines. These include habitat destruction, climate change, increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation, environmental contamination, disease, and the introduction of non-native species. In this paper, we argue that amphibian population declines are caused by different abiotic and biotic factors acting together in a context-dependent fashion. Moreover, different species and different populations of the same species may react in different ways to the same environmental insult. Thus, the causes of amphibian population declines will vary spatially and temporally. Although some generalizations (e.g. those concerning environmental stress and disease outbreaks) can be made about amphibian population declines, we suggest that these generalizations take into account the context-dependent dynamics of ecological systems.

To allow analyses of global patterns, and to detect the effects of ongoing climate change, such data are urgently needed. In this paper, we describe a systematic effort to characterise the high-Arctic Hymenoptera and Diptera parasitoid community associated with Lepidoptera hosts of the Zackenberg Valley (74 degrees 30'N, 21 degrees 00'W), northeast Greenland. Here, we first sampled adult parasitoids by a combination of Malaise traps, pitfall traps, and, less extensively, yellow pan traps and sweep netting. We then identified the host use of individual parasitoid taxa by rearing a large number of host individuals and species across multiple years. We now describe our preliminary findings on the species diversity of the target community, on trophic links between hosts and parasitoids, and on the sampling effort and techniques needed to characterise the community. We report on 30 local parasitoid taxa representing four families, three of which are species new to Greenland. In describing the community, we make a specific effort to summarise what is known about the taxonomy, phenology, and host use of the component species, to the benefit of future research in the area.

Climate change-mediated temperature extremes and insects: From outbreaks to breakdowns	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Review								Insects are among the most diverse and widespread animals across the biosphere and are well-known for their contributions to ecosystem functioning and services. Recent increases in the frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes (CE), in particular temperature extremes (TE) owing to anthropogenic climate change, are exposing insect populations and communities to unprecedented stresses. However, a major problem in understanding insect responses to TE is that they are still highly unpredictable both spatially and temporally, which reduces frequency- or direction-dependent selective responses by insects. Moreover, how species interactions and community structure may change in response to stresses imposed by TE is still poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of how terrestrial insects respond to TE by integrating their organismal physiology, multitrophic, and community-level interactions, and building that up to explore scenarios for population explosions and crashes that have ecosystem-level consequences. We argue that TE can push insect herbivores and their natural enemies to and even beyond their adaptive limits, which may differ among species intimately involved in trophic interactions, leading to phenological disruptions and the structural reorganization of food webs. TE may ultimately lead to outbreak-breakdown cycles in insect communities with detrimental consequences for ecosystem functioning and resilience. Lastly, we suggest new research lines that will help achieve a better understanding of insect and community responses to a wide range of CE.

An increasing number of environmental challenges, including habitat loss, pathogens, and global warming, demand a global response toward the sustainable management of ecosystems and their biodiversity. Conservation Breeding Programs (CBPs) are needed for the sustainable management of amphibian species threatened with extinction. CBPs support species survival while increasing public awareness and political influence. Current CBPs only cater for 10% of the almost 500 amphibian species in need. However, the use of sperm storage to increase efficiency and reliability, along with an increased number of CBPs, offer the potential to significantly reduce species loss. The establishment and refinement of techniques over the last two decades, for the collection and storage of amphibian spermatozoa, gives confidence for their use in CBPs and other biotechnical applications. Cryopreserved spermatozoa has produced breeding pairs of frogs and salamanders and the stage is set for Lifecycle Proof of Concept Programs that use cryopreserved sperm in CBPs along with repopulation, supplementation, and translocation programs. The application of cryopreserved sperm in CBPs, is complimentary to but separate from archival gene banking and general cell and tissue storage. However, where appropriate amphibian sperm banking should be integrated into other global biobanking projects, especially those for fish, and those that include the use of cryopreserved material for genomics and other research. Research over a broader range of amphibian species, and more uniformity in experimental methodology, is needed to inform both theory and application. Genomics is revolutionising our understanding of biological processes and increasingly guiding species conservation through the identification of evolutionary significant units as the conservation focus, and through revealing the intimate relationship between evolutionary history and sperm physiology that ultimately affects the amenability of sperm to refrigerated or frozen storage. In the present review we provide a nascent phylogenetic framework for integration with other research lines to further the potential of amphibian sperm banking. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET				Review								Societal Impact Statement Edible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) have been consumed since ancestral times by humans either as food, medicine or for ceremonial use. Nowadays, they are a non-timber forest product and a diverse genetic resource with great ecological, sociocultural, economic, medicinal and biotechnological relevance around the world. Therefore, they have a paramount role to play in meeting the United Nations global sustainable development goals 2030. EMF may promote forest sustainability, biodiversity conservation, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions through the maintenance of forest masses, human nutrition and health, economic development, conservation of biocultural heritages, women empowerment and hunger mitigation. We provide a worldwide review of the knowledge, biodiversity, novel approaches, future challenges and perspectives in the post-COVID era of this important genetic resource whose relevance has usually received marginal attention despite its strategic global significance. Ectomycorrhizal fungi play a key role in the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They have a paramount importance in nutrient cycling, plant protection against pathogens and abiotic stress, and establishment of underground networks that connect trees and other plants in nature, therefore being the wood wide web, the 'internet' of the forests. According to our literature review, globally 970 mycorrhizal fungal species (including both mushrooms and truffles) are edible, and they have enormous relevance either as a source of subsistence in low-income human groups around the world or as an important economic component whose international commerce is worth billions of American dollars annually. Since edible mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a non-timber forest product, their sustainable use and management is crucial in order to maintain forest stands and to provide well-being to the human communities surrounding the forested areas where they grow. In different parts of the world, different cultures have developed a traditional knowledge of EMF over millennia. Their knowledge might play an important role in food supply and food security in the future, hence contributing towards the "zero hunger" global goal. The biotechnological development of EMF has also been crucial in the establishment of plantations, or successful reforestation and ecosystem restoration, which contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a worldwide review of how EMF might contribute to forest sustainability, food supply, biocultural conservation, and hunger and climate change mitigation is addressed by analysing the similarities, contrasts and challenges in all five continents.

This results in major economic losses in agriculture and forestry every year. Climate change aggravates the adverse effects of combined stresses and increases such losses. Trees suffer even more from the recurrence of biotic and abiotic stress combinations owing to their long lifecycle. Despite the effort to study the damage from individual stress factors, less attention has been given to the effect of the complex interactions between multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. In this review, we assess the importance, impact, and mitigation strategies of climate change driven interactions between biotic and abiotic stresses in forestry. The ecological and economic importance of biotic and abiotic stresses under different combinations is highlighted by their contribution to the decline of the global forest area through their direct and indirect roles in forest loss and to the decline of biodiversity resulting from local extinction of endangered species of trees, emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and reduction in the productivity and quality of forest products and services. The abiotic stress factors such as high temperature and drought increase forest disease and insect pest outbreaks, decrease the growth of trees, and cause tree mortality. Reports of massive tree mortality events caused by "hotter droughts" are increasing all over the world, affecting several genera of trees including some of the most important genera in plantation forests, such as Pine, Poplar, and Eucalyptus. While the biotic stress factors such as insect pests, pathogens, and parasitic plants have been reported to be associated with many of these mortality events, a considerable number of the reports have not taken into account the contribution of such biotic factors. The available mitigation strategies also tend to undermine the interactive effect under combined stresses. Thus, this discussion centers on mitigation strategies based on research and innovation, which build on models previously used to curb individual stresses.

It is categorized as endangered by the IUCN and by Canada under the Species at Risk Act and was recently proposed for listing in the U.S. as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Whitebark pine populations are declining nearly rangewide primarily from the spread and intensification of Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch., the exotic, invasive pathogen that causes white pine blister rust (WPBR); recent, large-scale outbreaks of mountain pine beetles (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins); altered fire regimes; and, multiple impacts from climate change. For more than two decades, researchers and managers within the U.S. Forest Service and Canadian forestry agencies have been developing restoration and conservation tools and techniques to help mitigate these threats. Four conservation and restoration principles for whitebark pine were previously emphasized: (1) conserve genetic diversity, (2) promote WPBR resistance, (3) protect seed sources, and (4) deploy restoration treatments, while mitigating for climate change. These principles are served by ten additional management or conservation actions that form the basis of a restoration and adaptive management plan but apply primarily to regions with moderate to high levels of WPBR and MPB outbreaks. Where the pathogen and MPB are absent or present at low levels, managers can implement proactive management to build resilience to prevent the future loss of ecological function. Here, we review the key management actions currently used for whitebark pine conservation and restoration in the U.S. and Canada, which include gene conservation, increasing natural genetic resistance to C. ribicola, cone collections, growing and planting seedlings or directly sowing seeds, protecting seed sources, prescribed fire and silvicultural thinning to reduce competition in late seral communities, proactive intervention, stand health surveys and monitoring, and monitoring the impacts of restoration for adaptive management. This review is the outcome of an experts' workshop held in association with the development of the National Whitebark Pine Restoration Plan (NWPRP), a collaborative U.S. multi- agency and tribal effort initiated in 2017 in consultation with the U.S. Forest Service and facilitated by the non-profit organizations, the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation and American Forests.

Ecosystem Impacts of Exotic Annual Invaders in the Genus Bromus	EXOTIC BROME-GRASSES IN ARID AND SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS OF THE WESTERN US: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES, AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS	Springer Series on Environmental Management			Article; Book Chapter								An understanding of the impacts of exotic plant species on ecosystems is necessary to justify and guide efforts to limit their spread, restore natives, and plan for conservation. Invasive annual grasses such as Bromus tectorum, B. rubens, B. hordeaceus, and B. diandrus (hereafter collectively referred to as Bromus) transform the structure and function of ecosystems they dominate. Experiments that prove cause-and-effect impacts of Bromus are rare, yet inferences can be gleaned from the combination of Bromus-ecosystem associations, ecosystem condition before/after invasion, and an understanding of underlying mechanisms. Bromus typically establishes in bare soil patches and can eventually replace perennials such as woody species or bunchgrasses, creating a homogeneous annual cover. Plant productivity and cover are less stable across seasons and years when Bromus dominates, due to a greater response to annual climate variability. Bromus' "flash" of growth followed by senescence early in the growing season, combined with shallow rooting and annual habit, may lead to incomplete use of deep soil water, reduced C sequestration, and accelerated nutrient cycling. Litter produced by Bromus alters nearly all aspects of ecosystems and notably increases wildfire occurrence. Where Bromus has become dominant, it can decrease soil stability by rendering soils bare for months following fire or episodic, pathogen-induced stand failure. Bromus-invaded communities have lower species diversity, and associated species tend to be generalists adapted to unstable and variable habitats. Changes in litter, fire, and soil properties appear to feedback to reinforce Bromus' dominance in a pattern that portends desertification.

However, due to climate change and large-scale ongoing movement of breeding individuals, the expansion of bees of African origin could represent another threat. This issue has not yet been recognised in detail, although bees bearing African mitochondrial DNA occur in South-West and South Europe due to natural gene flow. Here, we determine the diversity of mitochondrial DNA in honey bees from East-Central Europe. We sequenced the COI-COII region in 427 bees sampled along two 900 km transects (17.5 degrees N and 23 degrees E). We found that 1.64% of bees (95% CI: 0.66-3.35%) had African mitochondrial DNA. It is unlikely that their presence in the area resulted from natural migration but instead human-driven introductions of hybrids of African ancestry. This expansion deserves more attention, as it may contribute to the dissemination of undesirable traits, parasites and diseases. In Europe, protecting the genetic diversity of Apis mellifera is usually perceived in the context of limiting the spread of the evolutionary C-lineage within the original range of the M-lineage. However, due to climate change and large-scale ongoing movement of breeding individuals, the expansion of bees from the African A-lineage could represent another threat. This issue has not yet been investigated in detail, although A-mitotypes occur in South-West and South Europe due to natural gene flow. Here, we determine the diversity of mtDNA in honey bees from East-Central Europe. We sequenced the COI-COII region in 427 bees sampled along two 900 km transects (17.5 degrees N and 23 degrees E).

A 2x5 factorial design field experiment performed with large mesocosms for >2 months was used to quantify the dynamics of the entire HMFW (bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, and viruses) after an experimental P-enrichment gradient which approximated or surpassed current atmospheric P pulses in the presence vs. absence of ultraviolet radiation. HMFW underwent a mid-term (<20 days) acute development following a noticeable unimodal response to P enrichment, which peaked at intermediate P-enrichment levels and, unexpectedly, was more accentuated under ultraviolet radiation. However, after depletion of dissolved inorganic P, the HMFW collapsed and was outcompeted by a low-diversity autotrophic compartment, which constrained the development of HMFW and caused a significant loss of functional biodiversity. The dynamics and relationships among variables, and the response patterns found, suggest the importance of biotic interactions (predation/parasitism and competition) in restricting HMFW development, in contrast to the role of abiotic factors as main drivers of autotrophic compartment. The response of HMFW may contribute to ecosystem resilience by favoring the maintenance of the peculiar paths of energy and nutrient-mobilization in these pristine ecosystems, which are vulnerable to threats by the joint action of abiotic stressors related to global change.

Collapsing foundations: The ecology of the British oak, implications of its decline and mitigation options	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				Review								Oak (Quercus spp.) is declining globally due to a variety of pests, pathogens and climate change. Assessments of the impact of losing keystone species such as oak, should include the impact on associated biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and consider mitigation options. Here, we assess the potential ecological implications of a decline in Quercus petraea/robur within the UK. We collated a database of 2300 species associated with Q. petraea/robur of which 326 were found to be obligate associates (only found on Q. petraea/robur). One potential mitigating measure for lessening the impact of oak decline on associated biodiversity would be establishing alternative tree species. However, of 30 alternative tree species assessed, none supported a high proportion of the oak-associated species (maximum 28% by Fraxinus excelsior ash, which is currently declining due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, a fungus). However, the functioning of oak (leaf litter/soil chemistry and decomposition) was potentially replicable owing to its similarities with other tree species. The impact on the four main oak woodland communities within the UK, of a theoretical 50% decline in oak on ecosystem functioning and associated species was explored for five scenarios, that differed in the selection of replacement tree species. The most resilient woodland communities (in all the aspects assessed) were those capable of supporting the greatest diversity of tree species and when the currently occurring tree species replaced oak. The greatest change was predicted where F. excelsior was lost in addition to a decline in oak, and if only one species, particularly Acer pseudoplantanus sycamore, filled the canopy gaps.

Hypotheses on such changes in the geographic distribution of a certain species can be evaluated using population genetic structure and demography. In this study we explore the population genetic structure, genetic variability, demographic history of, and habitat suitability forAmblyomma americanum, a North American tick species that is a known vector of several pathogenic microorganisms. We used a double digestion restriction site-associated DNA sequencing technique (dd-RAD seq) and discovered 8,181 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 189 ticks from across the geographic range of the species. Genetic diversity was low, particularly when considering the broad geographic range of this species. The edge populations were less diverse than populations belonging to the historic range, possibly indicative of a range expansion, but this hypothesis was not statistically supported by a test based on genetic data. Nonetheless, moderate levels of population structure and substructure were detected between geographic regions. For New England, demographic and species distribution models support a scenario whereA. americanumwas present in more northern locations in the past, underwent a bottleneck, and subsequently recovered. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that this species is re-establishing in this area, rather than one focused on range expansion from the south. This hypothesis is consistent with old records describing the presence ofA. americanumin the northeastern US in the early colonial period.

Seaweed production: overview of the global state of exploitation, farming and emerging research activity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY				Article								The use of seaweeds has a long history, as does the cultivation of a select and relatively small group of species. This review presents several aspects of seaweed production, such as an update on the volumes of seaweeds produced globally by both extraction from natural beds and cultivation. We discuss uses, production trends and economic analysis. We also focus on what is viewed as the huge potential for growing industrial-scale volumes of seaweeds to provide sufficient, sustainable biomass to be processed into a multitude of products to benefit humankind. The biorefinery approach is proposed as a sustainable strategy to achieve this goal. There are many different technologies available to produce seaweed, but optimization and more efficient developments are still required. We conclude that there are some fundamental and very significant hurdles yet to overcome in order to achieve the potential contributions that seaweed cultivation may provide the world. There are critical aspects, such as improving the value of seaweed biomass, along with a proper consideration of the ecosystem services that seaweed farming can provide, e.g. a reduction in coastal nutrient loads. Additional considerations are environmental risks associated with climate change, pathogens, epibionts and grazers, as well as the preservation of the genetic diversity of cultivated seaweeds. Importantly, we provide an outline for future needs in the anticipation that phycologists around the world will rise to the challenge, such that the potential to be derived from seaweed biomass becomes a reality.

Ian; Provan, Jim			Strong spatial structuring of clonal genetic diversity within blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) hedgerows and woodlands	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES				Article								Hedgerows are an important component of agricultural landscapes, but in recent years have increasingly faced threats such as habitat loss, land use change, climate change, invasive species, pests and plant pathogens. Given the potential importance of genetic diversity in countering these threats, and the spatial distribution of such diversity within and across natural populations, we analyzed levels and patterns of diversity in blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), a key component of many hedgerows. Twenty-one populations of blackthorn from a mixture of hedgerows and woodlands were genotyped for four nuclear and five chloroplast microsatellites. Three hundred twenty-one unique clonal genotypes were identified from 558 individuals analyzed, 207 of which were found in a single individual. With the exception of a single population that appears to have been planted recently from seed (Peatlands Park), all populations exhibited evidence of vegetative reproduction via suckering. Multi-ramet clones were highly spatially structured within populations, and ranged in size from < 1 to 258 m. These findings indicate that asexual reproduction is widespread in the populations of blackthorn studied. Although levels of clonality varied across study sites, there was clear spatial structuring of clones in each case. Such clonal organization should be taken into account in hedge management or where planting or replanting of hedgerows becomes necessary. Knowledge of the patterns and extent of spatial structuring of genotypes within potential source populations will allow the selection of genetically divergent material, rather than selection of clonal replicates of the same genotype.

Exploring the role of physiology and biotic interactions in determining elevational ranges of tropical animals	ECOGRAPHY				Review								Tropical mountains contain some of the world's richest animal communities as a result of high turnover of species along elevational gradients. We describe an approach to study the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in establishing elevational ranges, and to improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these communities. As a framework we use Hutchinson's concept of the fundamental niche (determined by the match between the physical environment and the organism's physiological and biophysical characteristics) and realized niche (the subset of the fundamental niche determined by biotic interactions). Using tropical birds as an example, we propose a method for estimating fundamental niches and discuss five biotic interactions that we expect to influence distributions of tropical montane animals: predation, competition, parasites and pathogens, mutualisms, and habitat associations. The effects of biotic factors on elevational ranges have been studied to some extent, but there is little information on physiological responses of tropical montane animals. It will be necessary to understand all of these ecological constraints in concert to predict current and future elevational ranges and potential threats to montane species. Given the importance of tropical mountains as global biodiversity hotspots, we argue that this area of research requires urgent attention.

Substantial heritable variation for susceptibility to Dothistroma septosporum within populations of native British Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)	PLANT PATHOLOGY				Article								The threat from pests and pathogens to native and commercially planted forest trees is unprecedented and expected to increase under climate change. The degree to which forests respond to threats from pathogens depends on their adaptive capacity, which is determined largely by genetically controlled variation in susceptibility of the individual trees within them and the heritability and evolvability of this trait. The most significant current threat to the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is dothistroma needle blight (DNB), caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. A progeny-population trial of 4-year-old Scots pine trees, comprising six populations from native Caledonian pinewoods each with three to five families in seven blocks, was artificially inoculated using a single isolate of D. septosporum. Susceptibility to D. septosporum, assessed as the percentage of non-green needles, was measured regularly over a period of 61 days following inoculation, during which plants were maintained in conditions ideal for DNB development (warm; high humidity; high leaf wetness). There were significant differences in susceptibility to D. septosporum among families indicating that variation in this trait is heritable, with high estimates of narrow-sense heritability (0.38-0.75) and evolvability (genetic coefficient of variation, 23.47). It is concluded that native Scots pine populations contain sufficient genetic diversity to evolve lower susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to increased prevalence of this pathogen.

Alien species invasions have been hypothesized to be important to zoonotic diseases by introducing both existing and novel pathogens to invaded ranges. However, few studies have evaluated the generality of alien species facilitating zoonoses across multiple host and parasite taxa worldwide. Here, we simultaneously quantify the role of 795 established alien hosts on the 10,473 zoonosis events across the globe since the 14(th) century. We observe an average of similar to 5.9 zoonoses per alien zoonotic host. After accounting for species-, disease-, and geographic-level sampling biases, spatial autocorrelation, and the lack of independence of zoonosis events, we find that the number of zoonosis events increase with the richness of alien zoonotic hosts, both across space and through time. We also detect positive associations between the number of zoonosis events per unit space and climate change, land-use change, biodiversity loss, human population density, and PubMed citations. These findings suggest that alien host introductions have likely contributed to zoonosis emergences throughout recent history and that minimizing future zoonotic host species introductions could have global health benefits.

The isolation of xeric valleys surrounded by complex mountain ranges in Oaxaca supplies an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of the Pleistocene events on xeric species. To test for the alternative hypotheses of Pleistocene glacial refugia, we used sequences of two chloroplast markers to examine the phylogeographic patterns of the endemic mistletoe species Psittacanthus auriculatus (Loranthaceae) across its known range in Oaxaca and conducted ecological niche modeling (ENM) to explore changes of its distribution range through present, future, and palaeo periods. Our results revealed two groups corresponding to the distribution of individuals/populations from the northern locations (western valleys), and those from southern localities at central valleys of Oaxaca. A significant genetic signal of differentiation, demographic stability, and contraction of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum predicted by ENMs strongly supported a scenario of habitat fragmentation during the Late Pleistocene. We conclude that the genetic differentiation of P. auriculatus is consistent with a model of range contraction during glacial cycles and expansion during interglacials with no major range changes under future scenarios of climate change. The findings verified the profound effects of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on this endemic mistletoe species, and the low genetic diversity within populations highlights, paradoxically, the urgency of preserving vulnerable populations of endemic yet parasitic mistletoes.

Feeding everyone: Solving the food crisis in event of global catastrophes that kill crops or obscure the sun	FUTURES				Article								Mass human starvation is currently likely if global agricultural production is dramatically reduced for several years following a global catastrophe, e.g. super volcanic eruption, asteroid or comet impact, nuclear winter, abrupt climate change, super weed, extirpating crop pathogen, super bacterium, or super crop pest. This study summarizes the severity and probabilities of such scenarios, and provides an order of magnitude technical analysis comparing caloric requirements of all humans for 5 years with conversion of existing vegetation and fossil fuels to edible food. Here we present mechanisms for global-scale conversion including natural gas-digesting bacteria, extracting food from leaves, and conversion of fiber by enzymes, mushroom or bacteria growth, or a two-step process involving partial decomposition of fiber by fungi and/or bacteria and feeding them to animals such as beetles, ruminants (cattle, sheep, etc.), rats and chickens. We perform an analysis to determine the ramp rates for each option and the results show that careful planning and global cooperation could maintain humanity and the bulk of biodiversity.

Risk factors on corn production specific for Dobrogea agricultural area are: the attack of fungal pathogens from primary inoculum that survive in the soil and on the plant debris: Aspergillus flavus (aspergillus or yellow mould); Giberella zeae/anamorph Fusarium graminearum (gibberella ear rot) and Giberella fujikuroi/anamorph F. verticilloides (fusarium ear rot); wrong conception of crop rotation (wheat - corn) and drought causing water stress in corn, as an indicator of climate change. To bring together relevant knowledge and experience for Dobrogea farmers about improvements in fungi biodiversity, the research are focus on developing new methodologies for assessing toxigenic-pathogenic and beneficial fungi, leading to a quantitative risk-benefit assessment strategy.

J	Raguso, RA				Raguso, Robert A.			Coevolution as an engine of biodiversity and a cornucopia of ecosystem services	PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET				Article								Societal Impact Statement Coevolutionary processes, which have governed interactions between organisms throughout the history of life, also serve as an engine of ecosystem services for humans. The escalating arms races between plants and herbivores, flowers and pollinators, have generated a cornucopia of foods, raw materials, perfumes, spices, ornamentals, medicines, and drugs. Human history is replete with aesthetic as well as economic inspiration drawn from such plants. Our future may depend on similar inspiration, as we confront novel health, agricultural, and environmental challenges in the face of global change. Summary "Coevolution" was coined to conceptualize escalating arms races between plants and herbivores in evolutionary time, often mediated by natural products. Our current view embraces broader coevolutionary relationships between obligate mutualists, symbionts, parasites, and enemies, which frequently increase rates of diversification in coevolving lineages. Because humans benefit from the foods, materials, and drugs produced by plants in response to reciprocal selective pressures, coevolutionary "escape and radiate" diversification may amplify ecosystem services along with species richness, with humans as beneficiaries. For example, coevolutionary escalation of defenses between Burseraceae and their herbivores resulted in hundreds of resinous tree species, anchoring the trade of copal, frankincense, and myrrh across the ancient world. Examination of three diverse angiosperm orders (Asparagales, Malpighiales, and Gentianales), reveals ecosystem services in the form of alkaloids and hallucinogens, perfumes, spices, coffee, and rubber. Pollinator-mediated selection by hawk moths and bats gave rise to heavily perfumed "moonflowers" (gardenias and jasmines) with aesthetic appeal to humans, and to immense blooming displays by agave plants, co-opted by humans as a source of tequila and mezcal. Even when pollinator-mediated diversification does not arise through coevolution, the resulting biotic richness provides evolutionary insights as well as ecosystem services. The convergent evolution of "kettle-trap" flowers in species-rich plant lineages (Aristolochia and Ceropegia) reveals the surprising value of small flies as pollinators and the opportunity to develop biocontrol that leverages floral features attractive to agricultural pests and disease vectors. This article highlights coevolution as a source of ecosystem services and potential solutions to the emerging challenges of global change.

Biomolecules such as DNA infuse each drop of ocean water, grain of sediment, and breath of ocean air. The Ocean Biomolecular Observing Network (OBON) is developing a global collaboration that will allow science and society to understand ocean life like never before. The program will transform how we sense, harvest, protect, and manage ocean life using molecular techniques, as it faces multiple stresses including pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. It will also help communities detect biological hazards such as harmful algal blooms and pathogens, and be a key component of next-generation ocean observing systems. OBON will encourage continuous standardization and intercalibration of methods and data interoperability to help enhance and future-proof capabilities. OBON's objectives are: 1) to build a coastal-to-open ocean multi-omics biodiversity observing system; 2) to develop and transfer capacity between partners; 3) to enhance marine ecosystem digitization and modelling and 4) to coordinate action on pressing scientific, management, and policy questions.

J	Kapsa, JS				Kapsa, Jozefa S.			Important Threats in Potato Production and Integrated Pathogen/Pest Management	POTATO RESEARCH				Article								Since the 1970s climate in Europe warmed rapidly. Over the next years climate is expected to become gradually milder and more humid in northern Europe and hotter and drier in southern Europe. These changes are forecasted to be responsible for major changes in the distribution of plant and animal species, pathogen/pest prevalence and their biodiversity. On the other hand, some changes in variability and epidemiology of pathogens are affected by biological factors. In the first part of this paper an overview is given of pathogens and pests that are potentially affected by climate change and are or will become a significant threat in potato production. The second part of the paper deals with integrated crop protection of potato against various pathogens and pests, considered the best solution for these disease and pest problems. Management of persistent and recurrent diseases and pests of potato requires the integration of many control measures to achieve an efficient crop protection. The protection of potato has to start very early before planting.

Urban renewable energy and ecosystems: integrating vegetation with ground-mounted solar arrays increases arthropod abundance of key functional groups	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS				Article								Cities are increasingly developing renewable energy within urban areas, yet the implications for ecosystems have not been explored. This study brings together climate change mitigation policies and ecosystem conservation in urban areas by investigating how ground-mounted solar arrays in parking lots affect arthropod abundance and biodiversity. We assess which arthropods are present under these solar canopies and investigate how integration of vegetation under the solar arrays affects arthropod abundance, abundance of different functional groups, and family richness. We sampled arthropods, collected data on habitat characteristics, and evaluated landscape cover within 2 km of eight study sites around San Jose and Santa Cruz, California. We found substantial abundance and diversity of arthropods underneath ground-mounted solar arrays in urban area parking lots, and that arrays integrated with vegetation have significantly greater arthropod abundance and more detritivores, parasitoids, and family richness. The results demonstrate that ground-mounted solar arrays in parking lots, especially when integrated with vegetation, can be a win-win for climate mitigation, arthropod richness, and ecosystem functioning.

These ecological modifications have threatened the apiculture including the bees and wild pollinators which plays a vital role and are indispensable in the terrestrial ecosystems. This chapter presents the foundational space of apiculture, challenges, and emerging techniques of the apiarists in beekeeping including precision apiculture, and a low-cost IoT and remote sensing technology deployed for data gathering and monitoring the vigor and productivity of beehive colonies. The system has redundancy components and utilized the three-level hierarchical model including wireless node, local information server, and the cloud data server. The system also consists of sensors deployed across distinct locations to capture the beehives' temperature, relative humidity, and loads of the hives and honeycombs, and stored to the local and cloud server. This system will complement the urgent need to countervail the honeybee colonies' collapse by helping the apiarists, apiculture subsector, and agriculture sector to embark emerging precision apiculture technologies.

J	Grant, WS				Grant, W. Stewart			Understanding the adaptive consequences of hatchery-wild interactions in Alaska salmon	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				Article								About 31% of salmon harvested in Alaska comes from the hatchery production of hundreds of millions of pink and chum salmon and smaller numbers of sockeye, Chinook, and coho salmon. The numbers of hatchery-reared juveniles released in some areas are greater than the numbers of juveniles from wild populations. However, virtually nothing is known about the effects of hatchery fish on wild populations in Alaska. Possible effects of these interactions can be inferred from studies of salmonids in other areas, from studies of other animals, and from theory. Numerous studies show a complex relationship between the genetic architecture of a population and its environment. Adaptive responses to nature and anthropogenic selection can be influenced by variation at a single gene, or more often, by the additive effects of several genes. Studies of salmonids in other areas show that hatchery practices can lead to the loss of genetic diversity, to shifts in adult run timing and earlier maturity, to increases in parasite load, to increases in straying, to altered levels of boldness and dominance, to shifts in juvenile out-migration timing, and to changes in growth. Controlled experiments across generations show, and theory predicts, that the loss of adaptive fitness in hatchery salmon, relative to fitness in wild salmon, can occur on a remarkably short time scale. All of these changes can influence survival and impose selective regimes that influence genetically based adaptive traits. The preservation of adaptive potential in wild populations is an important buffer against diseases and climate variability and, hence, should be considered in planning hatchery production levels and release locations. The protection of wild populations is the foundation for achieving sustained harvests of salmon in Alaska.

J	Ganie, SA; Bhat, JA; Devoto, A				Ganie, Showkat Ahmad; Bhat, Javaid Akhter; Devoto, Alessandra			The influence of endophytes on rice fitness under environmental stresses	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				Review								Key Message Endophytes are crucial for the promotion of rice growth and stress tolerance and can be used to increase rice crop yield. Endophytes can thus be exploited in biotechnology and genetic engineering as eco-friendly and cost-effective means for the development of high-yielding and stress-tolerant rice plants. Rice (Oryza sativa) crop is continuously subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses, compromising growth and consequently yield. The situation is exacerbated by climate change impacting on ecosystems and biodiversity. Genetic engineering has been used to develop stress-tolerant rice, alongside physical and chemical methods to mitigate the effect of these stresses. However, the success of these strategies has been hindered by short-lived field success and public concern on adverse effects associated. The limited success in the field of stress-tolerant cultivars developed through breeding or transgenic approaches is due to the complex nature of stress tolerance as well as to the resistance breakdown caused by accelerated evolution of pathogens. It is therefore necessary to develop novel and acceptable strategies to enhance rice stress tolerance and durable resistance and consequently improve yield. In the last decade, plant growth promoting (PGP) microbes, especially endophytes, have drawn the attention of agricultural scientists worldwide, due to their ability to mitigate environmental stresses in crops, without causing adverse effects. Increasing evidence indicates that endophytes effectively confer fitness benefits also to rice under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Endophyte-produced metabolites can control the expression of stress-responsive genes and improve the physiological performance and growth of rice plants. This review highlights the current evidence available for PGP microbe-promoted tolerance of rice to abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought and to biotic ones, with special emphasis on endophytes. Associated molecular mechanisms are illustrated, and prospects for sustainable rice production also in the light of the impending climate change, discussed.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH				Article								In the time of ongoing climate change and the increasing area of post-mining landscape, the successful afforestation of reclamation sites by suitable adaptive tree species is gaining in importance. One of possible ways may be the use of introduced tree species, which is, however, a controversial topic in relation to risks for forest management and nature conservation. The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the forest stands (age 48 years) of 9 introduced and 3 native coniferous tree species in lowland post-mining coal site of the Czech Republic. The research was focused on production potential, health status, resistance to climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil properties. The highest timber production, biomass and carbon stock (49-95% above average), was observed in case of Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra and Pseudotsuga menziesii. On the other hand, unsuitable habitat, insect and pathogens caused poor health status and extremely low production parameters (by 55-62% than average) in Pinus strobus and P. rotundata. In terms of climate, Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, Larix decidua, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea omorika were the most resistance tree species in relation to climatic extremes. Conversely, Pinus rotundata, P. strobus, P. ponderosa, Picea pungens and P. abies were very sensitive to climate events, especially to the lack of precipitation in vegetation period with synergism of high temperature. In terms of soil parameters, the content of plant available nutrients (K, Ca, Mg) was adequate except P deficiency. The highest soil reaction was detected for Pinus nigra and P. sylvestris (pH 6.9-7.1) compared to Picea mariana (pH 4.8). The benefits of "suitable" introduced tree species (Pinus nigra, Pseudotsuga menziesii) are high timber production potential and good adaptation and mitigation of the changing climate; however, native tree species (Pinus sylvestris, Larix decidua) can provide better environmental benefits on reclamation sites.

Leighton			Differential Resistance to Tree Species Loss between Two Dominant Communities in a Resilient Southeastern Landscape	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL				Article								The southern Cumberland Plateau is a resilient landscape, meaning one that can resist or rebound from a suite of interacting disturbances such as climate change, herbivore release, introduced pathogens, and fire suppression. This region possesses several attributes that contribute to landscape resilience, including topographic variability, high species diversity, geological heterogeneity, and landscape connectivity. However, individual communities within the region may have different levels of resiliency. We used a 19-year study of forest change in two adjacent Cumberland Plateau communities to test for differences in ecological resistance to species loss. We found that the study area experienced a net loss of 7 species, with more species disappearing from the cove (-9 species) than the upland (-3 species). In the cove forest, the smallest size classes experienced significant species loss, with a mean loss of 4.8 and 6.0 species for sapling size classes, leading to a skewed size distribution with the majority of woody species represented by large adults. Upland communities maintained their structure, possibly due to a greater prevalence of stem and root sprouting species. From these results, we conclude that the upland community was more resistant to species loss and better maintained its structure compared to the cove community. Differential change between two adjacent communities highlights that the purported landscape resilience of the southern Cumberland Plateau may vary between its two most dominant communities.

Several potential factors have been studied as possible causes of declining pollinator health, such as parasites and pathogens, exposure to agricultural pesticides, habitat loss and/or climate change. More recently, a combination of these factors rather than a single cause have been blamed for observed pollinator losses, but field studies of such interactions are challenging, especially in the presence of confounding environmental stressors. We therefore examined the impact of single and combined stressors on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) in a generally healthy Australian population. We exposed workers during their larval development and drones until they reached sexual maturity to the neonicotinoid pesticide Thiamethoxam, at concentrations more than 20 times lower than we initially measured in the field, the microsporidian gut pathogen Nosema apis or both stressors at the same time. We found that simultaneous exposure significantly reduced bee health. We observed a substantial increase in mortality and a reduction of immunocompetence in workers exposed to both the pathogen and the pesticide. We conclude that the exposure of generally healthy bees to multiple environmental stressors results in synergistic effects where the effects are expected to negatively impact performance and could be sufficient to trigger colony collapse. We found that the vast majority of males did not survive to sexual maturity after exposure to very low levels of Thiamethoxam. This would not only reduce the reproductive success of individual colonies, but can also impact gene flow and genetic diversity at the population level, which are both known as key components of honey bee health.

Rich and cold: diversity, distribution and drivers of fungal communities in patterned-ground ecosystems of the North American Arctic	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				Article								Fungi are abundant and functionally important in the Arctic, yet comprehensive studies of their diversity in relation to geography and environment are not available. We sampled soils in paired plots along the North American Arctic Transect (NAAT), which spans all five bioclimatic subzones of the Arctic. Each pair of plots contrasted relatively bare, cryoturbated patterned-ground features (PGFs) and adjacent vegetated between patterned-ground features (bPGFs). Fungal communities were analysed via sequencing of 7834 ITS-LSU clones. We recorded 1834 OTUs - nearly half the fungal richness previously reported for the entire Arctic. These OTUs spanned eight phyla, 24 classes, 75 orders and 120 families, but were dominated by Ascomycota, with one-fifth belonging to lichens. Species richness did not decline with increasing latitude, although there was a decline in mycorrhizal taxa that was offset by an increase in lichen taxa. The dominant OTUs were widespread even beyond the Arctic, demonstrating no dispersal limitation. Yet fungal communities were distinct in each subzone and were correlated with soil pH, climate and vegetation. Communities in subzone E were distinct from the other subzones, but similar to those of the boreal forest. Fungal communities on disturbed PGFs differed significantly from those of paired stable areas in bPGFs. Indicator species for PGFs included lichens and saprotrophic fungi, while bPGFs were characterized by ectomycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi. Our results suggest that the Arctic does not host a unique mycoflora, while Arctic fungi are highly sensitive to climate and vegetation, with potential to migrate rapidly as global change unfolds.

Recently, a very harmful phytopathogenic organism has been detected in the Balearic Islands: Xylella fastidiosa. It is a plant pathogen that causes mortality without cure in a large number of important woody crops such as olives, grapevines, almonds and citrus trees. This paper discusses an approach to the study of the spatial distribution of the pathogen in the Balearic Islands and a potential distribution model of the pathogen in the Iberian Peninsula, which is developed and based on the records of its presence in the Balearic Islands. The preliminary results point to a high incidence of Xylella fastidiosa in the Balearic Islands and they forecast a wide potential distribution of Xylella fastidiosa in the Iberian Peninsula, especially where the minimum temperatures of coldest month of the year are milder.

Pine savanna restoration on agricultural landscapes: The path back to native savanna ecosystem services	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				Article								Restoration of savanna ecosystems within their historic range is expected to increase provision of ecosystem services to resident human populations. However, the benefits of restoration depend on the degree to which ecosystems and their services can be restored, the rate of restoration of particular services, and tradeoffs in services between restored ecosystems and other common land uses. We use a chronosequence approach to infer multi-decadal changes in ecosystem services under management aimed at restoring fire-dependent pine savannas, including the use of frequent prescribed fire, following abandonment of row-crop agriculture in the southeastern U.S. We compare ecosystem services between restored pine savannas of different ages and reference pine savannas as well as other common land uses (row-crop agriculture, improved pasture, pine plantation, unmanaged forest). Our results suggest that restoring pine savannas results in many improvements to ecosystem services, including increases in plant species richness, perennial grass cover, tree biomass, total ecosystem carbon, soil carbon and C:N, reductions in soil bulk density and predicted erosion and sedimentation, shifts from soil fungal pathogens to fungal symbionts, and changes in soil chemistry toward reference pine savanna conditions. However, the rate of improvement varies widely among services from a few years to decades. Compared to row-crop agriculture and improved pasture, restored savannas have lower erosion, soil bulk density, and soil pathogens and a higher percentage of mycorrhizal fungi and ecosystem carbon storage. Compared to pine plantations and unmanaged forests, restored pine savannas have lower fire-prone fuel loads and higher water yield and bee pollinator abundance. Our results indicate that restoration of pine savanna using frequent fire provides a broad suite of ecosystem services that increase the landscape's overall resilience to climate change. These results are likely relevant to other savannas dominated by perennial vegetation and maintained with frequent fire. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The improved housing efficiency and resilience will contribute to strengthen sanitation and hygiene, improve the living comfort and reduce environmental impact, particularly focusing on preserving the forest biodiversity. The project was developed following the criteria of environmental, technical, social and economic sustainability to propose a shared model, reproducible by the beneficiaries living in different kinds of Mosquitian ecosystems. Increased building efficiency is obtained through optimization of construction techniques and improvement of materials' performances. The main material of the proposed dwelling is wood, coherently with the "Miskita" tradition; the increase of its durability, which is obtained by proper seasoning and protection from atmospheric agents and parasites, contributes to the optimization of the use of this natural resource and to reducing the impact on deforestation, which threatens forest biodiversity. The data collection campaign, conducted before developing the housing model design and which has aimed at obtaining information on technical and social aspects related to residences' welfare and health conditions, has highlighted the great importance of improving the construction model. Despite the advance in sanitary conditions and the economic level, the data collection campaign revealed that even the most developed communities amongst those visited have been perpetrating substantial construction errors, which reduce the resilience of structures to extreme natural phenomena, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which frequently affect the Mosquitia region. This unexpected discovery increased the importance of housing model design in order to correct these improper construction techniques and avoid their application in the newly-started village growth.

Cork oak forests occupy more than 2 million hectares worldwide, being mainly located in Algeria, Morocco, Portugal and Spain. As in other Mediterranean ecosystems, cork oak forests have been reported as important reservoirs of biological diversity, including endemic species that are currently under threat due to abiotic and biotic stress. Despite the adaptation of cork oak to the Mediterranean climate, which is characterised by warm, dry summers and wet winters, the growth and productivity of this species is sensitive to climatic change and variability. Extended periods of high temperature and/or low precipitation leading to low level of available water in the soil, can trigger the decline of cork oak and increase vulnerability to pathogen attack. Plant microbiomes are major factors for preserving plant health and productivity under challenging climates and their endophytic components can have dual ecological function, both as detrimental microbes or as beneficial symbionts. Endophytes can play beneficial roles for plant health and productivity but some can become opportunistic pathogens that take advantage of weakened plants that are stressed by environmental conditions. This review discusses endophytes in the context of Mediterranean bioclimates, the geographic distribution of cork oaks and the spread of opportunistic disease-causing agents. Some studies have begun to characterise and isolate endophytes from cork oak, which represents the first steps towards understanding how cork oak endophytes might help ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change for this tree species.

Loss of genetic diversity, recovery and allele surfing in a colonizing parasite, Geomydoecus aurei	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				Article								Understanding the genetic consequences of changes in species distributions has wide-ranging implications for predicting future outcomes of climate change, for protecting threatened or endangered populations and for understanding the history that has led to current genetic patterns within species. Herein, we examine the genetic consequences of range expansion over a 25-year period in a parasite (Geomydoecus aurei) that is in the process of expanding its geographic range via invasion of a novel host. By sampling the genetics of 1,935 G. aurei lice taken from 64 host individuals collected over this time period using 12 microsatellite markers, we test hypotheses concerning linear spatial expansion, genetic recovery time and allele surfing. We find evidence of decreasing allelic richness (AR) with increasing distance from the source population, supporting a linear, stepping stone model of spatial expansion that emphasizes the effects of repeated bottleneck events during colonization. We provide evidence of post-bottleneck genetic recovery, with average AR of infrapopulations increasing about 30% over the 225-generation span of time observed directly in this study. Our estimates of recovery rate suggest, however, that recovery has plateaued and that this population may not reach genetic diversity levels of the source population without further immigration from the source population. Finally, we employ a grid-based sampling scheme in the region of ongoing population expansion and provide empirical evidence for the power of allele surfing to impart genetic structure on a population, even under conditions of selective neutrality and in a place that lacks strong barriers to gene flow.

Spring wheat crops dominate in the Urals, Volga region, and Western Siberia. Wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is an important disease, impacting greatly on wheat production. In Russia, the disease was an annual problem until 2010 but has since been more effectively controlled. However, changes in virulence in pathogen populations may arise from climate change, evolving cropping practices, intense use of chemical protectants, and an increase in the release of resistant cultivars. In the 2000s, the State Register of the Russian Federation included an increase in the number of winter and spring wheat cultivars resistant to leaf rust. However, successful genetic protection requires a diversity of cultivars with different resistance genes (Lr genes). Studies by the All Russian Institute of Plant Protection identified Lr genes in Russian cultivars' phenotypes and molecular markers. In addition, the prevalence of virulence in pathogen populations was studied and the influence of the cultivar used in wheat production on the changes in these populations was evaluated. This paper reviews research on the genetic diversity of winter and spring wheat cultivars included in the State Register of Russia from 2000 to 2020 and analyzes their impact on the prevalence of virulence in pathogen populations. These data demonstrate the continuous evolution of P. triticina in response to wheat breeding efforts. Populations of the pathogen showed higher variability in regions where pathotype-specific resistance cultivars were commonly grown.

To unravel ecological dependencies, we address how long-term climatic changes have shaped the co-occurrence of plants and fungi across selected sites in Siberia. We investigated sedimentary ancient DNA from five lakes spanning the last 47,000 years, using the ITS1 marker for fungi and the chloroplast P6 loop marker for vegetation metabarcoding. We obtained 706 unique fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 243 taxa for the plants. We show higher OTU numbers in dry forest tundra as well as boreal forests compared to wet southern tundra. The most abundant fungal taxa in our dataset are Pseudeurotiaceae, Mortierella, Sordariomyceta, Exophiala, Oidiodendron, Protoventuria, Candida vartiovaarae, Pseudeurotium, Gryganskiella fimbricystis, and Tricho-sporiella cerebriformis. The overall fungal composition is explained by the plant composition as revealed by redundancy analysis. The fungal functional groups show antagonistic relationships in their climate susceptibility. The advance of woody taxa in response to past warming led to an increase in the abun-dance of mycorrhizae, lichens, and parasites, while yeast and saprotroph distribution declined. We also show co-occurrences between Salicaceae, Larix, and Alnus and their associated pathogens and detect higher mycorrhizal fungus diversity with the presence of Pinaceae. Under future warming, we can expect feedbacks between fungus composition and plant diversity changes which will affect forest advance, species diversity, and ecosystem stability in arctic regions.

Part 2: Meteorus trachynotus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)	FORESTS				Article								This is the second article of a series of three where we develop temperature-driven models to describe the seasonal interactions between parasitoids and their hosts which we use to explore the impact of climate on their spatiotemporal biology. Here, we model the biology of Meteorus trachynotus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) with an individual-based model of its daily interactions with two host species. This model predicts the performance of the parasitoid in response to temperature affecting its seasonal development and that of the two hosts. We compare model output with an extensive set of field observations from natural host populations. The predicted activity of the first adult parasitoid generation closely matches the seasonal pattern of attack on the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) within the limitations of available data. The model predicts 1-4 full generations of M. trachynotus per year in eastern North America, with generations well synchronized with larvae of a known overwintering host, the obliquebanded leafroller Choristoneura rosaceana. The model predicts the observed density dependence of parasitism on spruce budworm. Predicted performance exhibits spatial variation caused by complex life-history interactions, especially synchrony with the overwintering host. This leads to a better performance in warm but not hot environments at middle latitudes and elevations. The model's predicted spatial patterns correspond closely to our field observations on the frequency of parasitism on spruce budworm. Under climate change, the model predicts that the performance of M. trachynotus populations will improve in the northern portion of its range.

Part 1:Tranosema rostrale(Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae)	FORESTS				Article								Despite their importance as mortality factors of many insects, the detailed biology and ecology of parasitoids often remain unknown. To gain insights into the spatiotemporal biology of insect parasitoids in interaction with their hosts, modeling of temperature-dependent development, reproduction, and survival is a powerful tool. In this first article of a series of three, we modeled the biology ofTranosema rostraleat the seasonal level with a three-species individual-based model that took into account the temperature-dependent performance of the parasitoid and two of its hosts. The predicted activity of the first adult parasitoid generation closely matched the seasonal pattern of attack on the spruce budworm,Choristoneura fumiferana(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). The model predicted 1-4 full generations ofT. rostraleper year in eastern North America. The generations were generally well synchronized with the occurrence of larvae of a probable alternate host, the obliquebanded leafrollerChoristoneura rosaceana(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), which could be used as an overwintering host. Spatial differences in predicted performance were caused by complex interactions of life-history traits and synchrony with the overwintering host, which led to a better overall performance in environments at higher elevations or along the coasts. Under a climate warming scenario, regions of higherT. rostraleperformance were predicted to generally move northward, making especially lower elevations in the southern range less suitable.

While most studies have focused on flowering time, microbial effects remain important for host survival and fitness across all phenological phases. Microbe-mediated changes in nutrient acquisition and phytohormone signaling can release plants from stressful conditions and alter plant stress responses inducing shifts in developmental events. The frequency and direction of phenological effects appear to be partly determined by the lifestyle and the underlying nature of a plant-microbe interaction (i.e., mutualistic or pathogenic), in addition to the taxonomic group of the microbe (fungi vs. bacteria). Finally, we highlight biases, gaps in knowledge, and future directions. This biotic source of plasticity for plant adaptation will serve an important role in sustaining plant biodiversity and managing agriculture under the pressures of climate change.

Epidemics not only lead to disastrous loss of human life but may also have catastrophic economic, political and social consequences. Outbreaks may rapidly jeopardize industry, trade or tourism in countries that are unprepared. Dengue is currently spreading throughout the tropics, while another arbovirus, chikungunya, infected 30 to 75 % of the population in some parts of the Indian Ocean region between 2005 and 2006. Chikungunya is now spreading through India, where more than a million people have so far been infected. This viral disease can cause lasting disability, and the first deaths were recently reported in La Reunion and Mayotte. All countries are at risk from emerging or re-emerging diseases, but the consequences are far worse in poor countries. Microbial pathogens and wild mammals, birds and arthropods do not respect man-made borders. There is still time to act against this threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, through prevention, anticipation, monitoring and research.

Thanks to their essential service of pollination, these insects allow the maintenance of biodiversity and the variety and amount of food available. Unfortunately, we are observing an increasingly devastating reduction of bee families and other pollinating insects for factors related to human activities, environmental pollution, diseases and parasites, compromise of natural habitats, and climate change. We show that probiotics can protect bees from element pollution. We collected bees, beeswax, honey, pollen, and propolis directly from hives in a rural area of central Italy to investigate the content of 41 elements in control (not supplemented with probiotics) and experimental (supplemented with probiotics) groups. Our data show a significantly lower concentration of some elements (Ba, Be, Cd, Ce, Co, Cu, Pb, Sn, Tl, and U) in experimental bees than in control groups, indicating a possible beneficial effect of probiotics in reducing the absorption of chemicals. This study presents the first data on element levels after probiotics have been fed to bees and provides the basis for future research in several activities relating to the environment, agriculture, economy, territory, and medicine.

However, the ecological drivers explaining these decoupled ecological and evolutionary patterns remain poorly understood. We identified the ecological predictors of such a decoupled pattern between bacterial and fungal diversity across a 4100 km latitudinal transect, from tropical to temperate forests in eastern China. Bacterial diversity showed a hump-shaped trend with latitude, while the diversity of fungi, and especially fungal saprobes and pathogens decreased with increasing latitude. In addition, our results provided evidence that while temperature and primary productivity, which decreased with increasing latitude, were the best predictors of fungal diversity, soil properties such as pH and N:P ratio were the best predictors for the latitudinal pattern in bacterial diversity. Further statistical results showed that sampling bias should be carefully considered in disentangling the underlying mechanisms of microbial geographical distribution. Our findings suggest that temperature is more likely to associate with fungal diversity than with bacterial diversity in eastern China, with important implications for the prediction of soil biodiversity and functions under climate change scenarios.

J	Yumurtaci, A				Yumurtaci, Aysen			Utilization of wild relatives of wheat, barley, maize and oat in developing abiotic and biotic stress tolerant new varieties	EMIRATES JOURNAL OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE				Review								Dramatic changes in climatic conditions, exhibited as heat waves, water scarcity and heavy rains, continue to threaten crop quality and yield. Additionally, fungal-based plant pathogen booming is another reflection of climate change creating some potential risks for agricultural production of main staple crop species. Most of the abiotic and biotic stresses are under the control of complex traits. Moreover, a wide range of desirable quantitative characters in cultivated crops, such as disease resistance, might degenerate with time. Therefore, buffering crops against the large environmental changes is important for feeding the world's increasing population and requires implementation of effective food security strategies. Crop biodiversity plays a key role in the improvement of stress tolerant species and enables an extensive platform for identification of novel traits by using a range of molecular tools. This offers homozygous crop models for the traits of interest, prediction models related to the stress tolerance and genetic resources for the transformation of cultivated crops. This review provides an overview for application of different crop wild relatives and demonstrates their roles on development of stress tolerant plants. It also highlights the importance of global crop conservation and alternative plant species for future plant breeding.

Wastewater as a Resource for Pest Control: An Overview	BIORESOURCES				Review								Pests have a negative impact on the economy and the environment. There is an increased urgency for adequate pest control because many pests show high adaptation and climate change has created favorable circumstances for pests. For pest control, synthetic chemicals are used that are lethal to non-target organisms and are toxic to pollinators and aquatic invertebrates. Chemical compounds in plants and derivatives from lignocellulosic materials act against pests. The wastewater from lignocellulosic biomass is a potential source of new compounds with bactericidal, fungicidal, and pesticidal effects that have demonstrated inhibitory activity against plant pathogens. Fungicidal, nematicidal, insecticidal, larvicidal, and bactericidal activities have been proven. Inorganic and organic compounds, such as phenols, aldehydes, esters, and furanics, are the main ones identified. Due to the antimicrobial activity of wastewater, applying it to the soil can modify the composition and structure of key microbial communities. Deep research about richness, biodiversity, functionality, and microbials is needed. This review provides a comprehensive overview of wastewater types that have been applied and possible sources to obtain potential compounds for pest control. Moreover, associated active compounds, recovery techniques, and environmental impacts are reviewed.

Here, we survey three species of crocodile icefish (Notothenioidei: Channichthyidae) collected from two island archipelagos in the southern Scotia Arc region for evidence of leech infestations. Specifically, we report on infestation prevalence, intensity, spatial patterns of relative abundances, size distribution of parasitized fish, and patterns of host and attachment site specificity. Our results reveal high levels of attachment area fidelity for each leech species. These results suggest skin thickness and density of the vascular network constrain leech attachment sites and further suggest trophic (i.e., post-cyclic) transmission to be an important axis of parasitization. We also demonstrate that, while leech species appear to be clustered spatially, this clustering does not appear to be correlated with fish biomass. This study illuminates the complex interactions among fish hosts and leech parasites in the Southern Ocean and lays the groundwork for future studies of Antarctic marine leech ecology that can aid in forecasting how host-parasite interactions may shift in the face of ongoing climate change.

To better understand the joint effects of seasonal temperature variation and host community composition on the pathogen transmission, a stage-structured periodic model is proposed by integrating seasonal tick development and activity, multiple host species and complex pathogen transmission routes between ticks and reservoirs. Two thresholds, one for tick population dynamics and the other for Lyme-pathogen transmission dynamics, are identified and shown to fully classify the long-term outcomes of the tick invasion and disease persistence. Seeding with the realistic parameters, the tick reproduction threshold and Lyme disease spread threshold are estimated to illustrate the joint effects of the climate change and host community diversity on the pattern of Lyme disease risk. It is shown that climate warming can amplify the disease risk and slightly change the seasonality of disease risk. Both the "dilution effect" and "amplification effect" are observed by feeding the model with different possible alternative hosts. Therefore, the relationship between the host community biodiversity and disease risk varies, calling for more accurate measurements on the local environment, both biotic and abiotic such as the temperature and the host community composition.

Here, we assessed the diversity of the nano-sized eukaryotic microbial wintertime community, using molecular ecological methods based on sequencing of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene clone libraries. The results demonstrate that a rich community of small eukaryotes inhabits the Baltic Sea ice and water during winter. The community was dominated by alveolates and stramenopiles. Ciliates and cercozoans were the richest groups present, while in contrast to previous studies, diatoms showed a lower richness than expected. Furthermore, fungi and parasitic Syndiniales were present both in the water and in the sea ice. Some of the organisms in the sea-ice community were active, based on the RNA data, but a number of organisms were inactive or remnants from the freezing process. The results demonstrate that the sea-ice communities in the Baltic Sea are highly diverse and that water and ice of different ages include different protistan assemblages. Our study emphasizes the potential loss in biodiversity through diminishing ice cover as a result of climate change.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of fungal pathogen infection and impact. Using a grassland global change and biodiversity experiment we show that the trade-off between plant growth and defense is the main determinant of infection incidence. In contrast, nitrogen addition only indirectly increased incidence via shifting plant communities towards faster growing species. Plant diversity did not decrease incidence, likely because spillover of generalist pathogens or dominance of susceptible plants counteracted negative diversity effects. A fungicide treatment increased plant biomass production and high levels of infection incidence were associated with reduced biomass. However, pathogen impact was context dependent and infection incidence reduced biomass more strongly in diverse communities. Our results show that a growth-defense trade-off is the key driver of pathogen incidence, but pathogen impact is determined by several mechanisms and may depend on pathogen community composition.

In this study, we used a young tree diversity experiment replicated at two sites in the UK to study the impacts of tree diversity and tree provenance (geographic origin) on the oak (Quercus robur) insect herbivore community and a specialist biotrophic pathogen, oak powdery mildew. Local UK, French, and Italian provenances were planted in monocultures, provenance mixtures, and species mixes, allowing us to test whether: (a) local and nonlocal provenances differ in their insect herbivore and pathogen communities, and (b) admixing trees leads to associational effects on insect herbivore and pathogen damage. Tree diversity had variable impacts on foliar organisms across sites and years, suggesting that diversity effects can be highly dependent on environmental context. Provenance identity impacted upon both herbivores and powdery mildew, but we did not find consistent support for the local adaptation hypothesis for any group of organisms studied. Independent of provenance, we found tree vigor traits (shoot length, tree height) and tree apparency (the height of focal trees relative to their surroundings) were consistent positive predictors of powdery mildew and insect herbivory. Synthesis. Our results have implications for understanding the complex interplay between tree identity and diversity in determining pest damage, and show that tree traits, partially influenced by tree genotype, can be important drivers of tree pest and pathogen loads.

Effects of Air Pollution on Ecosystems and Biological Diversity in the Eastern United States	YEAR IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY 2009	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences-Series			Article								Conservation organizations have most often focused on land-use change, climate change, and invasive species as prime threats to biodiversity conservation. Although air pollution is an acknowledged widespread problem, it is rarely considered in conservation planning or management. In this synthesis, the state of scientific knowledge on the effects of air pollution on plants and animals in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States is summarized. Four air pollutants (sulfur, nitrogen, ozone, and mercury) and eight ecosystem types ranging from estuaries to alpine tundra are considered. Effects of air pollution were identified, with varying levels of certainty, in all the ecosystem types examined. None of these ecosystem types is free of the impacts of air pollution, and most are affected by multiple pollutants. In aquatic ecosystems, effects of acidity, nitrogen, and mercury on organisms and biogeochemical processes are well documented. Air pollution causes or contributes to acidification of lakes, eutrophication of estuaries and coastal waters, and mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. In terrestrial ecosystems, the effects of air pollution on biogeochemical cycling are also very well documented, but the effects on most organisms and the interaction of air pollution with other stressors are less well understood. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence for effects of nitrogen deposition on plants in grasslands, alpine areas, and bogs, and for nitrogen effects on forest mycorrhizae. Soil acidification is widespread in forest ecosystems across the eastern United States and is likely to affect the composition and function of forests in acid-sensitive areas over the long term. Ozone is known to cause reductions in photosynthesis in many terrestrial plant species. For the most part, the effects of these pollutants are chronic, not acute, at the exposure levels common in the eastern United States. Mortality is often observed only at experimentally elevated exposure levels or in combination with other stresses such as drought, freezing, or pathogens. The notable exceptions are the acid/aluminum effects on aquatic organisms, which can be lethal at levels of acidity observed in many surface waters in the region. Although the effects are often subtle, they are important to biological conservation. Changes in species composition caused by terrestrial or aquatic acidification or eutrophication can propagate throughout the food webs to affect many organisms beyond those that are directly sensitive to the pollution. Likewise, sublethal doses of toxic pollutants may reduce the reproductive success of the affected organisms or make them more susceptible to potentially lethal pathogens. Many serious gaps in knowledge that warrant further research were identified. Among those gaps are the effects of acidification, ozone, and mercury on alpine systems, effects of nitrogen on species composition of forests, effects of mercury in terrestrial food webs, interactive effects of multiple pollutants, and interactions among air pollution and other environmental changes such as climate change and invasive species. These gaps in knowledge, coupled with the strong likelihood of impacts on ecosystems that have not been studied in the region, suggests that current knowledge underestimates the actual impact of air pollutants on biodiversity. Nonetheless, because known or likely impacts of air pollution on the biodiversity and function of natural ecosystems are widespread in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, the effects of air pollution sould be considered in any long-term conservation strategy. It is recommended that ecologically relevant standards, such as "critical loads," be adopted for air pollutants and the importance of long-term monitoring of air pollution and its effects is emphasized.

Important issues facing insect conservation in Australia: now and into the future	AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY				Review								Studies of insect biodiversity and conservation in Australia have been severely limited by the many undescribed species and paucity of taxonomists and insect ecologists. In this review, I discuss important issues facing insect conservation, namely, key threatening processes, threats to habitats and ecological communities, the importance of maintaining insect interactions, the value of vegetation remnants in agricultural ecosystems and the importance of community participation, and provide recommendations for the conservation management of invertebrates and their habitats. Major threats to insect biodiversity continue from habitat loss through broadscale clearing of native vegetation, invasion by weeds, habitat fragmentation, loss of natural corridors and inappropriate fire regimes. Other threats include disturbance of plant communities on hilltops, creek embankments and in water courses, pesticide regimes, trampling and grazing by stock and feral animals, and exotic predators. Climate change affects those insects constrained by their thermal and moisture tolerances (climate envelopes), potentially influencing their distribution, development and reproduction, by disrupting diapause and aestivation or inducing torpor. Protected areas under State jurisdiction are at risk without Commonwealth protection and increasingly threatening those insects occurring only in national parks and other conservation areas. For effective conservation of mainland national parks, overarching national EPBC Act legislation is needed to protect parks for conservation of animal and plant diversity and natural landscapes. Retention of native vegetation as refuges for beneficial insects near farmlands is known to contribute to environmentally clean pest control. Information on conservation of beneficial insects and their dependence on native plants as habitats is needed by farmers to promote identification and protection of natural refuges for pollinators, parasitoids and predators and to support the case against indiscriminate tree clearing. Important community conservation activities are underway in several States and Territories, but to be effective, increased support and funding from appropriate agencies is required.	[Sands, Don P.

Blister rust and western forest biodiversity: ecology, values and outlook for white pines	FOREST PATHOLOGY				Review								P>Eight white pine species are widely distributed among the forests of western Canada and the United States. The different forest communities with these species contribute biodiversity to the western landscape. The trees themselves provide various ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat and watershed protection. White pine communities range in elevation from lower to upper treeline, in successional stage from seral to climax, and in stand type from krummholz to closed-canopy forest. Many white pine species are moderately to strongly fire-dependent for regeneration; several species are extreme stress tolerators and persistent on harsh sites. Among the white pines are the oldest-living trees, the world's largest pines, species dependent on birds for seed dispersal, species important for grizzly bear habitat and species of high commercial timber value. The principal threats to white pine populations are blister rust (Cronartium ribicola, pathogen), fire suppression, succession, mountain pine beetle and climate change. Severe population declines in several white pine species are attributed to losses caused by these factors acting either alone or together, and sometimes in concert with logging and other land-use changes. The importance and particular interactions of these threats vary by region and species. For example, many northern and western populations of whitebark pine are seriously declining from a combination of mountain pine beetle outbreaks and severe blister rust infestations. As whitebark pines provide many keystone services on high-elevation sites, their loss would impact forest composition and structure, succession, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Although there are serious challenges to science-based management and conservation (especially in remote American wilderness areas), prompt and effective intervention promoting regeneration of blister rust-resistant white pines could mitigate these severe impacts.

J	Tylianakis, JM; Binzer, A				Tylianakis, Jason M.; Binzer, Amrei			Effects of global environmental changes on parasitoid-host food webs and biological control	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				Article								Global environmental changes threaten biodiversity and the interactions between species, and food-web approaches are being used increasingly to measure their community-wide impacts. Here we review how parasitoid host food webs affect biological control, and how their structure responds to environmental change. We find that land-use intensification tends to produce webs with low complexity and uneven interaction strengths. Dispersal, spatial arrangement of habitats, the species pool and community differences across habitats have all been found to determine how webs respond to landscape structure, though clear effects of landscape complexity on web structure remain elusive. The invasibility of web structures and response of food webs to invasion have been the subject of theoretical and empirical work respectively, and nutrient enrichment has been widely studied in the food-web literature, potentially driving dynamic instability and altering biomass ratios of different trophic levels. Combined with food-web changes observed under climate change, these responses of food webs could signal changes to biological control, though there have been surprisingly few studies linking food-web structure to pest control, and these have produced mixed results. However, there is strong potential for food-web approaches to add value to biological control research, as parasitoid host webs have been used to predict indirect effects among hosts that share enemies, to study non-target effects of biological control agents and to quantify the use of alternative prey resources by enemies. Future work is needed to link food-web interactions with evolutionary responses to the environment and predator prey interactions, while incorporating recent advances in predator biodiversity research. This holistic understanding of agroecosystem responses and functioning, made possible by food-web approaches, may hold the key to better management of biological control in changing environments.

J	Sanchez-Bayo, F; Wyckhuys, KAG				Sanchez-Bayo, Francisco; Wyckhuys, Kris A. G.			Worldwide decline of the entomofauna: A review of its drivers	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				Review								Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.

Mosquito-borne pathogens are responsible for millions of infections, mainly in tropical regions where marginalized human populations are located, and where in recent years processes of landscape anthropization have occurred. Anthropogenic landscape transformation is known to change species assemblages. However, the magnitude of these effects is largely unknown, and the effects of anthropogenic landscape transformation on sylvatic mosquito assemblages are poorly known in Mexican ecosystems. We evaluate how mosquito abundance, richness, and diversity change along a gradient of three human-modified landscapes?one highly anthropized, one moderately anthropized, and one slightly anthropized?within a tropical forest matrix in a Protected Natural Area in Chiapas. A total of 4 538 mosquitoes belonging to 23 species were captured and identified at the three sites. We found differences in the structure and abundance of the three mosquito assemblages. The species assemblage of the highly anthropized site was significantly different from the other sites, and the relative abundance of the assemblages increased with landscape anthropization. Our results suggest that landscape anthropization alters the composition and structure of mosquito assemblages, modifying the abundance and species richness of mosquitoes associated with sylvatic ecosystems. This could support the hypothesis of intermediate disturbance that suggests the diversity is maxi-mized when late and early successional species coexist in these ecosystems. This information is essential to understand the ecology of potential sylvatic vectors and the environmental factors that are involved in the emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne diseases.

To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted an in-situ simulation experiment using five precipitation gradients (natural precipitation, increased and decreased by 40%, and 80%) in a natural restoration grassland for three years. The composition of soil fungal communities and their functions were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing techniques. Although the change of precipitation did not change the diversity index of soil fungi, it changed the composition and function of dominant fungal community groups. Specifically, decreased precipitation resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of Dothideomycetes and Boeremia by up to 12.17% and 9.93%, respectively, while these decreased with increased precipitation. The abundance of Basidiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Agaricomycetes abundance decreased by up to 11.27%, 6.96%, and 11.46% with decreased precipitation, but also decreased by up to 10.9%, 1.73%, and 10.51% with increased precipitation, respectively. However, the abundance of Ascomycota, Pezizomycetes, and norank_Pezizales increased by up to 22.58%, 7.45%, and 6.95% with decreased precipitation, and increased by up to 12.05%, 8.43%, and 5.81% with increased precipitation, respectively. The number of dominant fungal groups with interactive relationships weakened by 34.93% and 8.7% under decreased precipitation by 80% and increased 80%, respectively. Precipitation change had no significant effect on the proportion of saprotrophs, while a decrease of precipitation increased the endophyte-plant pathogens by up to 58.0% and decreased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by up to 92.6%. In brief, the dominant soil fungal communities could adapt and respond to climate change by altering the proportion of different dominant fungal groups by responding to moisture patterns with changes in the interrelationships between microbial communities and the proportional distribution of functional groups.

Arctic systems in the Quaternary: ecological collision, faunal mosaics and the consequences of a wobbling climate	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY				Article								Climate oscillations and episodic processes interact with evolution, ecology and biogeography to determine the structure and complex mosaic that is the biosphere. Parasites and parasite-host assemblages are key components in a general explanatory paradigm for global biodiversity. We explore faunal assembly in the context of Quaternary time frames of the past 2.6 million years, a period dominated by episodic shifts in climate. Climate drivers cross a continuum from geological to contemporary timescales and serve to determine the structure and distribution of complex biotas. Cycles within cycles are apparent, with drivers that are layered, multifactorial and complex. These cycles influence the dynamics and duration of shifts in environmental structure on varying temporal and spatial scales. An understanding of the dynamics of high-latitude systems, the history of the Beringian nexus (the intermittent land connection linking Eurasia and North America) and downstream patterns of diversity depend on teasing apart the complexity of biotic assembly and persistence. Although climate oscillations have dominated the Quaternary, contemporary dynamics are driven by tipping points and shifting balances emerging from anthropogenic forces that are disrupting ecological structure. Climate change driven by anthropogenic forcing has supplanted a history of episodic variation and is eliminating ecological barriers and constraints on development and distribution for pathogen transmission. A framework to explore interactions of episodic processes on faunal structure and assembly is the Stockholm Paradigm, which appropriately shifts the focus from cospeciation to complexity and contingency in explanations of diversity.

To assess the possibility of using pathogen-derived resistance against the virus, the genetic diversity of BYDVs originating from different wheat-growing areas of Pakistan where its incidence has been higher was investigated. Wheat samples with suspected symptoms of BYDVs were screened for the presence of Barley yellow dwarf and Cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) subgroup 1 (Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV, BYDV-MAV, BYDV-SGV) and subgroup II (BYDV-RPV, CYDV-RPV, BYDV-GPV) by PCR using basic multiplex oligonucleotides designed on coat protein (CP) of the virus. Of 37 samples tested, 13 were positive for BYDV subgroup I and only one sample was positive for BYDV subgroup II. Samples positive for subgroup I were further tested by PCR, and results showed that 10 samples were positive for BYDV-PAV and three for BYDV-MAV. DNA sequences of CP region of nine isolates (BYDV-PAV) were determined and compared with available sequences in databases. Sequence analysis showed that three isolates (from Fatehjang, Nowshera and Attock districts) had maximum identity (92.894.6%) to BYDV-PAS, and six isolates (from Peshawar, Islamabad Swabi and Faisalabad districts) had maximum identity (99.399.7%) to BYDV-PAV. Thus BYDV-PAV species may be dominant in northern wheat-growing areas of Pakistan. The conserved nature of the BYDVs suggests that pathogen-derived resistance strategies targeting the coat protein of the virus are likely to provide protection under field conditions.

Landscape constraints on functional diversity of birds and insects in tropical agroecosystems	ECOLOGY				Article								In this paper, we analyzeatabases on birds and insects to assess patterns of functional diversity in human-dominated landscapes in the tropics. A perspective from developed landscapes is essential for understanding remnant natural ecosystems, because most species experience their surroundings at spatial scales beyond the plot level, and spillover between natural and managed ecosystems is common. Agricultural bird species have greater habitat and diet breadth than forest species. Based on a global data base, bird assemblages in tropical agroforest ecosystems were composed of disproportionately more frugivorous and nectarivorous, but fewer insectivorous bird species compared with forest. Similarly, insect predators of plant-feeding arthropods were more diverse in Ecuadorian agroforest and forest compared with rice and pasture, while, in Indonesia, bee diversity was also higher in forested habitats. Hence, diversity of insectivorous birds and insect predators as well as bee pollinators declined with agricultural transformation. In contrast, with increasing agricultural intensification, avian pollinators and seed dispersers initially increase then decrease in proportion. It is well established that the proximity of agricultural habitats to forests has a strong influence on the functional diversity of agroecosystems. Community similarity is higher among agricultural systems than in natural habitats and higher in simple than in complex landscapes for both birds and insects, so natural communities, low-intensity agriculture, and heterogeneous landscapes appear to be critical in the preservation of beta diversity. We require a better understanding of the relative role of landscape composition and the spatial configuration of landscape elements in affecting spillover of functionally important species across managed and natural habitats. This is important for data-based management of tropical human-dominated landscapes sustaining the capacity of communities to reorganize after disturbance and to ensure ecological functioning.

J	Espinosa, L; Franco, S; Chauzat, MP				Espinosa, L.; Franco, S.; Chauzat, M-P			Could Vespa velutina nigrithorax be included in the World Organisation for Animal Health list of diseases, infections and infestations?	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				Article								Vespa velutina nigrithorax is an invasive alien organism that has raised concerns in all beekeeping communities of invaded countries including the Republic of Korea, European countries and Japan. Known also as the yellow-legged hornet (or the 'Asian hornet'), it is native to northern India, eastern Nepal, Bhutan and the People's Republic of China. Given its climatic and biological characteristics and the effects of climate change, some coastal areas of North America, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are also susceptible to invasion. Vespa velutina nigrithorax notably affects managed honey-bee colonies by predation on foragers and causing a reduction in the collection of food resources. Being a generalist predator, the yellow-legged hornet also preys on other managed and wild pollinators, and therefore its impacts are not limited to the beekeeping sector but also represent a biodiversity concern. The purpose of this paper is to provide an assessment of V v. nigrithorax against the four criteria established in Chapter 1.2. of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code for the inclusion of a disease, infection or infestation in the OIE list. The work was requested by the OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases and presented to this Commission and to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission in September 2017. Owing to the lack of effective measures to prevent its spread, the fact that its legal situation in some countries is under the mandate of environmental authorities rather than Veterinary Services, and because it is not considered a disease or parasite, V v. nigrithorax is not currently being proposed for inclusion in the OIE list. At the end of the text, the statements from the two commissions are included and discussed.

In recent years, this disease has spread all over the Alps and it is now recorded over all Italian alpine regions, with several secondary green alder stands heavily affected. Old damaged stands show dramatic changes both in tree species composition and coverage. Investigations were carried out in Trentino province (northern Italy) to describe the pathological and ecological aspects of this phenomenon. Various fungi and insects were detected on declining trees, but no single agent appeared to be a primary cause; the most common coloniser of declining stems, Cryptodiaporthe oxystoma (Rehm) Urb., had an endophytic behaviour in green healthy tissues but failed to produce symptoms in artificial inoculations. There was a negative relation between altitude and alder decline. Furthermore, reduction in snow cover and trends of increase in winter temperature are possible influencing factors. The spread of the syndrome may be related to climate change, reducing green alder vigour and allowing opportunistic parasites to cause host decline.

J	Cortes, J				Cortes, Jorge			Bibliography on marine, oceanographic, geological and atmospheric research at Isla del Coco Nacional Park and adjacent waters, Pacific Costa Rica.	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL				Article								Isla del Coco (also known as Cocos Island), Pacific Costa Rica, has been visited and written about since the 16th Century, and since the late 1800' s many expeditions and scientists have carried out research in the Island. Here I compiled publications on marine biological, geological, oceanographic and atmospheric research done at Isla del Coco. A list of 599 scientific papers and chapters were compiled, together with 41 books, reports, Special Issues, theses and web sites, and ten historic books with descriptions of marine animals or environemnets. A mayority of the publications (425 or 66.4%) are related to marine biodiversity topics (species descriptions and lists of species); the most published groups are gastropods (81 papers), decapods (67) and bony fishes (66). There are no publications of several groups of animals that have been observed in the Island, for example free-living flat worms, parasites and nemerteans among others. Other topics with a large number of publications are, biogeography with 65, ecology (61) and geology (48); the most studied ecosystem are coral reefs with 14 papers. More publications are needed on many topics, such as impact of ilegal fishing and climate change on Isla del Coco National Park marine flora and fauna.

How the biodiversity sciences may aid biological tools and ecological engineering to assess the impact of climatic changes	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				Article								This paper addresses how climate changes interact with other global changes caused by humans (habitat fragmentation, changes in land use, bioinvasions) to affect biodiversity. Changes in biodiversity at all levels (genetic, population and community) affect the functioning of ecosystems, in particular host-pathogen interactions, with major consequences in health ecology (emergence and re-emergence; the evolution of virulence and resistance). In this paper, the authors demonstrate that the biodiversity sciences, epidemiological theory and evolutionary ecology are indispensable in assessing the impact of climate changes, and also for modelling the evolution of host-pathogen interactions in a changing environment. The next step is to apply health ecology to the science of ecological engineering.

Lyme borreliosis in Europe	EUROSURVEILLANCE				Review								Despite improvements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, Lyme borreliosis (LB) is still the most common arthropod-borne disease in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, with risk of infection associated with occupation (e. g. forestry work) and certain outdoor recreational activities (e. g. mushroom collecting). In Europe, LB is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. Recent surveys show that the overall prevalence of LB may be stabilising, but its geographical distribution is increasing. In addition, much remains to be discovered about the factors affecting genospecific prevalence, transmission and virulence, although avoidance of tick bite still appears to be the most efficient preventive measure. Uniform, European-wide surveillance programmes (particularly on a local scale) and standardisation of diagnostic tests and treatments are still urgently needed, especially in the light of climate change scenarios and land-use and socio-economic changes. Improved epidemiological knowledge will also aid development of more accurate risk prediction models for LB. Studies on the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem changes on LB emergence may identify new paradigms for the prevention and control of LB and other tick-borne diseases.

J	Noakes, DJ; Beamish, RJ; Kent, ML				Noakes, DJ; Beamish, RJ; Kent, ML			On the decline of Pacific salmon and speculative links to salmon farming in British Columbia	AQUACULTURE				Review								Pacific salmon abundance along the West Coast of Canada has been in sharp decline since the early 1990s, Declines have been most severe for coho and chinook salmon despite large additions of hatchery-reared fry and smolts. There is particular concern for populations of wild coho because, in addition to low abundance, up to 80% of the juvenile coho in the coastal waters has been identified as being produced by enhancement projects. The most likely reasons for the decline in Pacific salmon stocks include a combination of climate change, overfishing, and freshwater habitat destruction. There have also been suggestions that salmon farming in British Columbia has contributed to the decline of salmon stocks. The hypothesized effects of salmon farming include potential ecological interactions as well as disease concerns. In this paper, we consider the effects of climate change on the abundance of wild salmon stocks as well as potential genetic, ecological, and disease concerns. Shifts in climate in 1977 and 1989 resulted in significant changes in production for a number of marine fish species including Pacific salmon. These climate-related changes, combined with local overfishing and the loss of freshwater habitat, have left some salmon stocks at very low levels. Large-scale salmon enhancement projects have also resulted in significant ecological and genetic interactions with wild salmon, particularly for coho and chinook stocks. These interactions have tended to reduce genetic diversity and result in the replacement of wild salmon by hatchery fish. Hatcheries also represent a potential source of disease pathogens although the magnitude of the problem is difficult to quantify because the disease agents of concern are widespread in both wild and hatchery Pacific salmon as well as a number of non-salmonid hosts. In addition, the same antibiotics used in the salmon farming industry are also used in salmon enhancement projects, making it difficult to identify the source of some pathogens. Although farmed salmon are also a potential source for these disease pathogens, surveys of pathogens in wild and hatchery fish show no patterns that could be attributed to salmon fanning. Recent improvements in fish husbandry, including the development and widespread use of vaccines, have also reduced the risk of disease transfer from farmed fish to wild or hatchery fish. The combined evidence indicates that salmon farming, as currently practiced in British Columbia, poses a low risk to wild salmon stocks particularly when compared to other potential factors.

J	Mavilia, R; Pisani, R				Mavilia, Roberto; Pisani, Roberta			Blockchain for agricultural sector: The case of South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT				Article								New technologies are playing a fundamental role in the postmodern era of globalization where interpersonal interactions at the international level and the exchange of goods, services, information and capital are the basis of all activities. The agriculture sector is constantly facing numerous challenges including the steady growth of the population, climate change, the increasing number of catastrophes, the loss of biodiversity and the spread of parasites. This paper analyzes the impacts of Blockchain applications in agriculture and the food supply chain, through a survey literature review, providing the various players in the agriculture value chain with new tools and key technologies to improve production and distribution processes. To demonstrate the importance of applying the Blockchain in the agriculture sector, especially for emerging countries, the case of South Africa is examined. This focus is one of the unique aspects of this paper, which is the first to deal with this kind of solution applied to the South African context. Our findings indicate that Blockchain, in the e-agricultural context, has the potential for reshaping the entire sector, contributing also to the resolution of the food crisis. This paper discusses the overall implications, limits, challenges and potentials of these applications, from a critical point of view.

J	Mason, PA				Mason, Peri Alexandra			On the role of host phenotypic plasticity in host shifting by parasites	ECOLOGY LETTERS				Article								Ecological speciation appears to contribute to the diversification of insect herbivores and other parasites, which together comprise a major component of Earth's biodiversity. Host shifts are likely an important step in ecological speciation, and understanding how such shifts occur is critical to forming and testing hypotheses explaining parasite diversity. In this article, I argue that phenotypic variation in hosts arising from environmental variation (phenotypic plasticity) can promote shifts in parasites by bridging both spatiotemporal and phenotypic gaps between ancestral and novel hosts. This hypothesis, which I call the plastic-bridge hypothesis', is conceptually distinct from those invoking genetic variation in bridging these gaps. I describe the mechanistic basis of plastic bridges, review circumstantial evidence in support of the hypothesis and suggest strategies for testing it. I use herbivorous insects and their host plants as a model, but the proposed ideas apply to any system fitting a broad definition of a host-parasite relationship. The plastic-bridge perspective suggests that parasite diversity is not only due to divergent selection provided by hosts, but also to the intraspecific variation that facilitates shifts between them. This view is timely, as biological invasion and range shifts associated with climate change foster novel interactions between parasites and hosts.

Biotic Resistance to Plant Invasions	PLANT INVASIONS: The Role of Biotic Interactions	CABI Invasives Series			Article; Book Chapter								Biotic resistance to plant invasions takes many forms: consumption by native herbivores, competition with native plants and infection by native pathogens. But how often does biotic resistance prevent the damaging monocultures that typify the most problematic plant invaders, and how often is biotic resistance overwhelmed by the direct and indirect impacts of human activities? This chapter attempts to answer these questions, drawing on the long history of research into biotic resistance. We first briefly describe the major forms of biotic resistance to exotic plant invasions as an antecedent to other, more detailed chapters on competition, herbivory and pathogens. We then describe a new neutral model where variance in disturbance promotes invasions over the short term, but over longer timescales only propagule pressure drives invasions. These findings are a cautionary tale; pending increases in global trade and travel, particularly to the tropics, may provide the prerequisite disturbance and propagule pressure needed to ultimately stoke further invasions. Finally, we highlight case studies where invasions have been mitigated by restoration of biotic resistance from native herbivores and competitors. These studies provide strong empirical support that conservation of native biodiversity can be a nature-based solution to some invasions, although it remains to be seen if climate change will alter these effects over longer timescales.

J	Valladares, G; Cagnolo, L; Salvo, A				Valladares, Graciela; Cagnolo, Luciano; Salvo, Adriana			Forest fragmentation leads to food web contraction	OIKOS				Article								Fragmentation and loss of habitat are critical components of the global change currently threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We studied the effects of habitat loss through fragmentation on food web structure, by constructing and analyzing plant-herbivore and host-parasitoid food webs including more than 400 species and over 120 000 feeding records, in 19 Chaco Serrano remnants of differing areas. Food web structure was altered by habitat fragmentation, with different metrics being affected depending on interaction type, and with all changes being driven by the reduced size of networks in smaller fragments. Only connectance varied in both quantitative and qualitative analyses, being negatively related to area. In addition, the interactions were represented by proper successive subsets, modulated mainly by resource availability (plantherbivore) or consumer specialization (hostparasitoid), as forest size decreased. The results suggest that habitat loss has led to food web contraction around a central core of highly-connected species, for plantherbivore as well as for hostparasitoid systems. The study provides new insights into the effects of human perturbations on complex biological systems.

Sulfur (S) is one of the important soil nutrients, and it plays an important role in the nutrient cycle of grassland ecosystem. However, the impacts of S on soil fauna and subsurface detrital food webs in grassland ecosystems were rarely studied. Accordingly, to investigate the effects of sulfur deposition on soil nematodes and detrital food webs, we conducted a S addition experiment with distinct intensities from 0 to 50 g S m(-2) yr(-1) (S 0, S 1, S 2, S 5, S 10, S 15, S 20, and S 50) to simulated sulfur deposition in a meadow steppe of northern China. We documented a significant effect of S addition on the diversity and richness of nematodes, and the species richness of soil nematodes was high in the study site. But S addition had no significant effect on the total abundance and dominant species of nematodes (Cervidellus and Aphelenchus). Results of correlation analysis and structural equation modeling consistently indicated that omnivores-predators were significantly affected by sulfur addition. A significant increase in the Structural Index (which indicates food web structure) suggested increased top-down forces and changed community structure, although bacterivores, fungivores, plant parasites did not significantly. The present results suggest that sulfur deposition would change the composition of nematode community, affect the stability of nematode community structure, and increase the disturbance to the underground ecosystem. The study provides that the detailed information of the response of nematode to S deposition can be used to analyze the process of global change affecting the underground ecosystem.

The species pool in the surrounding landscape and the distance of crop from natural habitat are important for the conservation of enemy diversity and, in particular, the conservation of poorly-dispersing and specialized enemies. Hence, structurally complex landscapes with hi,gh habitat connectivity may enhance the probability of pest regulation. In contrast, generalist and highly vagile enemies may even A p rofit from the high primary productivity of crops at a landscape scale and their abundance may partly compensate for losses in enemy diversity. Conservation biological control also needs a multitrophic perspective. For example, entomopathogenic fungi, plant pathogens and endophytes as well as below- and above-ground microorganisms are known to influence pest-enemy interactions in ways that vary across spatiotemporal scales. Enemy distribution in agricultural landscapes is determined by beta diversity among patches. The diversity needed for conservation biological control may occur where patch heterogeneity at larger spatial scales is high. However, enemy communities in managed systems are more similar across space and time than those in natural systems, emphasizing the importance of natural habitat for a spillover of diverse enemies. According to the insurance hypothesis, species richness can buffer against spatiotemporal disturbances, thereby insuring functioning in changing environments. Seemingly redundant enemy species may become important under global change. Complex landscapes characterized by highly connected crop-noncrop mosaics may be best for long-term conservation biological control and sustainable crop production, but experimental evidence for detailed recommendations to design the composition and configuration of agricultural landscapes that maintain a diversity of generalist and specialist natural enemies is still needed.

Many factors including parasites, pathogens, pesticide residues, forage losses, and poor nutrition have been proposed to explain honey bee colony losses. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of honey bees and their role has been consistently reported in the literature. In recent years, there have been numerous scientific evidence that the intestinal microbiota plays an essential role in honey bee health. Management strategies, based on supplementation of the gut microbiota with probiotics, may be important to increase stress tolerance and disease resistance. In this review, recent scientific advances on the use of LABs as microbial supplements in the diet of honey bees are summarized and discussed. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are agriculturally important pollinators. Over the past decades, significant losses of wild and domestic bees have been reported in many parts of the world. Several biotic and abiotic factors, such as change in land use over time, intensive land management, use of pesticides, climate change, beekeeper's management practices, lack of forage (nectar and pollen), and infection by parasites and pathogens, negatively affect the honey bee's well-being and survival. The gut microbiota is important for honey bee growth and development, immune function, protection against pathogen invasion; moreover, a well-balanced microbiota is fundamental to support honey bee health and vigor. In fact, the structure of the bee's intestinal bacterial community can become an indicator of the honey bee's health status. Lactic acid bacteria are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of many insects, and their presence in the honey bee intestinal tract has been consistently reported in the literature. In the first section of this review, recent scientific advances in the use of LABs as probiotic supplements in the diet of honey bees are summarized and discussed. The second section discusses some of the mechanisms by which LABs carry out their antimicrobial activity against pathogens. Afterward, individual paragraphs are dedicated to Chalkbrood, American foulbrood, European foulbrood, Nosemosis, and Varroosis as well as to the potentiality of LABs for their biological control.

We primarily consider the ecological and physical resilience of aquaculture in the Gulf of Maine (GoM), where a thriving industry includes marine algae, extensive and intensive shellfish aquaculture, and a well-established Atlantic salmon industry, as well as the infrastructure required to support these economically important ventures. The historical record of sea surface temperature in the GoM, estimated from gridded, interpolatedin situmeasurements, shows considerable interannual and decade-scale variability superimposed on an overall warming trend. Climate model projections of sea surface temperature indicate that the surface waters in the GoM could warm 0.5-3.5 degrees C beyond recent values by the year 2100. This suggests that, while variability will continue, anomalous warmth of marine heatwaves that have been observed in the past decade could become the norm in the GoMca. 2050, but with the most significant impacts to existing aquaculture along the southernmost region of the coast. We consider adaptations leading to aquacultural resilience despite the effects of warming, larger numbers of harmful nonindigenous species (including pathogens and parasites), acidification, sea-level rise, and more frequent storms and storm surges. Some new species will be needed, but immediate attention to adapt existing species (e.g. preserve/define wild biodiversity, breed for temperature tolerance and incorporate greater husbandry) and aquaculture infrastructure can be successful.

J	Goulson, D; Nicholls, E				Goulson, Dave; Nicholls, Elizabeth			The canary in the coalmine; bee declines as an indicator of environmental health	SCIENCE PROGRESS				Review								Bee declines have received much attention of late, but there is considerable debate and confusion as to the extent, significance and causes of declines. In part, this reflects conflation of data for domestic honeybees, numbers of which are largely driven by economic factors, with those for wild bees, many of which have undergone marked range contractions but for the majority of which we have no good data on population size. There is no doubt that bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined along with availability of suitable nest sites, bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites and pathogens accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future, particularly for cool climate specialists such as bumblebees. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple, interacting stressors is driving honeybee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators. Bees have a high profile and so their travails attract attention, but these same stressors undoubtedly bear upon other wild organisms, many of which are not monitored and have few champions. Those wild insects for which we do have population data (notably butterflies and moths) are overwhelmingly also in decline. We argue that bee declines are indicators of pervasive and ongoing environmental damage that is likely to impact broadly on biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides.

J	Hulme, PE				Hulme, Philip E.			One Biosecurity: a unified concept to integrate human, animal, plant, and environmental health	EMERGING TOPICS IN LIFE SCIENCES				Review								In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the world has woken up to the importance of biosecurity and the need to manage international borders. Yet strong sectorial identities exist within biosecurity that are associated with specific international standards, individual economic interests, specific research communities, and unique stakeholder involvement. Despite considerable research addressing human, animal, plant, and environmental health, the science connections between these sectors remain quite limited. One Biosecurity aims to address these limitations at global, national, and local scales. It is an interdisciplinary approach to biosecurity policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and environmental health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. It provides an integrated perspective to address the many biosecurity risks that transcend the traditional boundaries of health, agriculture, and the environment. Individual invasive alien plant and animal species often have multiple impacts across sectors: as hosts of zoonotic parasites, vectors of pathogens, pests of agriculture or forestry, as well as threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. It is time these risks were addressed in a systematic way. One Biosecurity is essential to address several major sociological and environmental challenges to biosecurity: climate change, increasing urbanisation, agricultural intensification, human global mobility, loss of technical capability as well as public resistance to pesticides and vaccines. One Biosecurity will require the bringing together of taxonomists, population biologists, modellers, economists, chemists, engineers, and social scientists to engage in a new agenda that is shaped by politics, legislation, and public perceptions.

White pines, Ribes, and blister rust: integration and action	FOREST PATHOLOGY				Review								P>The preceding articles in this series review the history, biology and management of white pine blister rust in North America, Europe and eastern Asia. In this integration, we connect and discuss seven recurring themes important for understanding and managing epidemics of Cronartium ribicola in the white pines (five-needle pines in subgenus Strobus). Information and action priorities for research and management of the pathogen, telial and aecial hosts, and their interactions are listed in a detailed Appendix. Syntheses focused on genetics, plant disease, invasive species or forest management have provided alternative but knowledgeable lessons on the white pine blister rust pathosystem. Two critical issues for the conservation of white pines are to sustain ecosystems affected by blister rust and to maintain genetic diversity for adaptive traits such as disease resistance. Forest genetics includes tree improvement and molecular techniques for research; their application can increase rust resistance by artificial and natural selection. Silviculture augments genetics with methods to deploy and enhance resistance as well as to regenerate and tend white pine stands. Although cultivated or wild Ribes might serve as inoculum sources, silviculture and horticulture can reduce the risk of serious impacts from blister rust using genetics for breeding and epidemiology for hazard assessment and disease control. Climate change threatens to cause major alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, resulting in maladapted conifers succumbing to various diseases and insect outbreaks. In contrast, many white pine species have broad ecological ranges and are tolerant of harsh environments-traits that permit successful establishment and growth over wide geographic and altitudinal zones. Given appropriate management, white pines could thrive as valuable commercial and ecologically important keystone species. In an uncertain environment, adaptive management provides a learning and participatory approach for sustaining resilient ecosystems.	[Geils, B.

Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers. The cultivar structures are likely to be more complex, combining genotypes, plant species and associated symbionts. New tools to build and evaluate them are important if legumes are to deliver their exciting potential in terms of agricultural productivity and sustainability as well as for feed and food.

Developing Strategies to Help Bee Colony Resilience in Changing Environments	ANIMALS				Review								Simple Summary Modifications to natural environments demand that high-level adaptations be made by living beings in order to continue thriving in their specific ecosystems. Multiple scientific studies have unraveled the strengths and weaknesses of honeybees and may guide efforts of the beekeeping world in developing strategies favoring their resilience and survival. These strategies include nutrition and microbiota management, or parasite elimination and pesticide detoxification. Climate change, loss of plant biodiversity, burdens caused by new pathogens, predators, and toxins due to human disturbance and activity are significant causes of the loss of bee colonies and wild bees. The aim of this review is to highlight some possible strategies that could help develop bee resilience in facing their changing environments. Scientists underline the importance of the links between nutrition, microbiota, and immune and neuroendocrine stress resistance of bees. Nutrition with special care for plant-derived molecules may play a major role in bee colony health. Studies have highlighted the importance of pollen, essential oils, plant resins, and leaves or fungi as sources of fundamental nutrients for the development and longevity of a honeybee colony. The microbiota is also considered as a key factor in bee physiology and a cornerstone between nutrition, metabolism, growth, health, and pathogen resistance. Another stressor is the varroa mite parasite. This parasite is a major concern for beekeepers and needs specific strategies to reduce its severe impact on honeybees. Here we discuss how helping bees to thrive, especially through changing environments, is of great concern for beekeepers and scientists.

J	Crenna, E; Sala, S; Polce, C; Collina, E				Crenna, Eleonora; Sala, Serenella; Polce, Chiara; Collina, Elena			Pollinators in life cycle assessment: towards a framework for impact assessment	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				Article								Human activities are threatening biodiversity at an unprecedented scale and pace, thus potentially affecting also the provision of critical ecosystem services, including insect pollination. Insect pollinators play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption, especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading to pollinator populations' declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1) intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3) presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing conceptual and methodological gaps.

Localized carry-over effects of pond drying on survival, growth, and pathogen defenses in amphibians	ECOSPHERE				Article								Climate change is increasing variability in precipitation patterns in many parts of the globe. Unpredictable changes in water availability can be particularly challenging for organisms that rely on precipitation-fed water sources for completing their life cycle, such as many amphibian species. Although developmental plasticity can mitigate the impacts of changing environments for some species, this strategy can come at a cost to other fitness-linked traits, such as immune function. We investigated localized variation in the capacity to respond to pond drying and evaluated whether developmental responses induced carry-over effects in disease susceptibility in three leopard frog species (Rana [Lithobates] pipiens and Rana sphenocephala; two populations each, and one population of Rana chiricahuensis). Using mesocosms located near the site of collection (<15 km away) in five regions spanning a latitudinal gradient, we raised tadpoles under simulated fast drying, slow drying, or constant water levels. After metamorphosis, we characterized several aspects of the skin microbiome, immune function, and response to exposure to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Note that for R. chiricahuensis, the only carry-over effect measured was response to Bd exposure, for which we observed no effects of pond drying. We found that developmental plasticity in response to drying was rare, except in the southernmost population of R. sphenocephala. In this location, tadpoles responded by accelerating development, and frogs with shorter larval periods developed more severe infections following Bd exposure post-metamorphosis, suggesting a trade-off between surviving pond drying and pathogen defense investment. In the three other locations, a lack of accelerated metamorphosis in drying treatments was accompanied by increased mortality, decreased anti-Bd function of the microbiome, and/or greater Bd infection after exposure. Overall, results suggest that faster drying conditions will likely have negative impacts on amphibians with long larval periods, both directly and indirectly via carry-over effects. Because effects of drying exposure were not uniform within a species, our findings suggest that local responses may not be generalizable to other regions of the range. These multifaceted effects of climate change on pathogen defenses are increasingly relevant as emerging infectious diseases threaten global biodiversity.

However, less well understood is how global change will influence fungal diseases, especially in a natural ecosystem. We use data from a 6-yr factorial experiment with warming (simulated using infrared heaters) and altered precipitation treatments in a natural Tibetan alpine meadow ecosystem, from which we tested global change effects on foliar fungal diseases at the population and community levels, and evaluated the importance of direct effects of the treatments and community-mediated (indirect) effects (through changes in plant community composition and competence) of global change on community pathogen load. At the population level, we found warming significantly increased fungal diseases for nine plant species. At the community level, we found that warming significantly increased pathogen load of entire host communities, whereas no significant effect of altered precipitation on community pathogen load was detected. We concluded that warming influences fungal disease prevalence more than precipitation does in a Tibetan alpine meadow. Moreover, our study provides new experimental evidence that increases in disease burden on some plant species and for entire host communities is primarily the direct effects of warming, rather than community-mediated (indirect) effects.

Graph theory as an invasive species management tool: case study in the Sonoran Desert	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY				Article								Context Biodiversity in arid regions is usually concentrated around limited water resources, so natural resource managers have constructed artificial water catchments in many areas to supplement natural waters. Because invasive species may also use these waters, dispersing into previously inaccessible areas, the costs and benefits of artificial waters must be gauged and potential invasion- and climate changemanagement strategies assayed. Objectives We present a network analysis framework to identify waters that likely contribute to the spread of invasive species. Methods Using the Sonoran Desert waters network and the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus)-a known predator, competitor, and carrier of pathogens deadly to other amphibians-as an example, we quantified the structural connectivity of the network to predict regional invasion potential under current and two future scenarios (climate change and management reduction) to identify waters to manage and monitor for invasive species. Results We identified important and vulnerable waters based on connectivity metrics under scenarios representing current conditions, projected climatelimited conditions, and conditions based on removal of artificial waters. We identified 122,607 km(2) of land that could be used as a buffer against invasion and 67,745 km(2) of land that could be augmented by artificial water placement without facilitating invasive species spread. Conclusions Structural connectivity metrics can be used to evaluate alternative management strategies for invasive species and climate mitigation.

Plants also have several mechanisms to ameliorate or repair these effects and may acclimate to a certain extent to increased levels of UV-B. Nevertheless, plant growth can be directly affected by UV-B radiation. Response to UV-B also varies considerably among species and also cultivars of the same species. In agriculture, this may necessitate using more UV-B-tolerant cultivars and breeding new ones. In forests and grasslands, this will likely result in changes in species composition; therefore there are implications for the biodiversity in different ecosystems. Indirect changes caused by UV-B-such as changes in plant form, biomass allocation to parts of the plant, timing of developmental phases and secondary metabolism-may be equally, or sometimes more important than damaging effects of UV-B. These changes can have important implications for plant competitive balance, herbivory, plant pathogens, and biogeochemical cycles. These ecosystem-level effects can be anticipated, but not easily predicted or evaluated. Research at the ecosystem level for solar UV-B is barely beginning. Other factors, including those involved in climate change such as increasing CO2, also interact with UV-B. Such reactions are not easily predicted, but are of obvious importance in both agriculture and in nonagricultural ecosystems.

Escape from natural enemies during climate-driven range expansion: a case study	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				Article								1. A major, and largely unexplored, uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on biodiversity is the consequence of altered interspecific interactions, for example between parasitoids and their hosts. The present study investigated parasitism in the Brown Argus butterfly, Aricia agestis; a species that has expanded northward in Britain during the last 30 years in association with climate warming. 2. Aricia agestis larvae suffered lower mortality from parasitoids in newly colonised areas compared with long-established populations. This result was consistent over four consecutive generations (2 years) when comparing one population of each type, and also when several populations within the historical and recently colonised range of the species were compared within a single year. Thus, A. agestis appears to be partially escaping from parasitism as it expands northwards. 3. Reduced parasitism occurred despite the fact that several of the parasitoid species associated with A. agestis were already present in the newly colonised areas, supported predominantly by an alternative host species, the Common Blue butterfly, Polyommatus icarus. 4. As the species expand their distributions into areas of increased climatic suitability, invasion fronts may escape from natural enemies, enhancing rates of range expansion. The results suggest that the decoupling of interspecific interactions may allow some species to exploit a wider range of environments and to do so more rapidly than previously thought possible.

Tai, China: Abundance, community, and influence of air mass trajectories	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				Article								Bacteria are ubiquitous in the near-surface atmosphere where they constitute an important component of aerosols with the potential to affect climate change, ecosystems, atmospheric process and human health. Limitation in tracking bacterial diversity accurately has thus far prevented the knowledge of airborne bacteria and their pathogenic properties. We performed a comprehensive assessment of bacterial abundance and diverse community in PM2.5 collected at Mt. Tai, via high-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR. The samples exhibited a high microbial biodiversity and complex chemical composition. The dominating populations were gram-negative bacteria including Burkholderia, Delftia, Bradyrhizobium, and Methylobacterium. The PM mass concentration, chemical composition, bacterial concentration and community structure varied under the influence of different air-mass trajectories. The highest mass concentration of PM2.5 (61 mu g m(-3)) and major chemical components were recorded during periods when marine southeasterly air masses were dominant. The local terrestrial air masses from Shandong peninsula and its adjacent areas harbored highest bacterial concentration loading (602 cells m(-3)) and more potential pathogens at the site. In contrast, samples influenced by the longdistance air flow from Siberia and Outer Mongolia were found to have a highest richness and diversity as an average, which was also marked by the increase of dust-associated bacteria (Brevibacillus and Staphylococcus). The primary research may serve as an important reference for the environmental microbiologist, health workers, and city planners.

Here we ask to what extent are vascular plant species associated with forests, and does species' affinity to forests vary between European regions? Location Temperate and boreal forest biome of Northwestern and Central Europe. Methods We compiled EuForPlant, a new extensive list of forest vascular plant species in 24 regions spread across 13 European countries using vegetation databases and expert knowledge. Species were region-specifically classified into four categories reflecting the degree of their affinity to forest habitats: 1.1, species of forest interiors; 1.2, species of forest edges and forest openings; 2.1, species that can be found in forest as well as open vegetation; and 2.2, species that can be found partly in forest, but mainly in open vegetation. An additional "O" category was distinguished, covering species typical for non-forest vegetation. Results EuForPlant comprises 1,726 species, including 1,437 herb-layer species, 159 shrubs, 107 trees, 19 lianas and 4 epiphytic parasites. Across regions, generalist forest species (with 450 and 777 species classified as 2.1 and 2.2, respectively) significantly outnumbered specialist forest species (with 250 and 137 species classified as 1.1 and 1.2, respectively). Even though the degree of shifting between the categories of forest affinity among regions was relatively low (on average, 17.5%), about one-third of the forest species (especially 1.2 and 2.2) swapped categories in at least one of the study regions. Conclusions The proposed list can be used widely in vegetation science and global change ecology related to forest biodiversity and community dynamics. Shifting of forest affinity among regions emphasizes the importance of a continental-scale forest plant species list with regional specificity.

J	Giltrap, D; Cavanagh, J; Stevenson, B; Ausseil, AG				Giltrap, Donna; Cavanagh, Jo; Stevenson, Bryan; Ausseil, Anne-Gaelle			The role of soils in the regulation of air quality	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Review								Soils play a key role in meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this study, we review the contribution of soils to the regulation of air quality, which is one of 'Nature's Contributions to People' identified by the Intergovernmental-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This is particularly relevant for SDG3 (health and well-being) and 11 (sustainable cities and well-being) but also impacts other SDGs. Soils can act as both a source and a sink of air pollutants (and their precursors). In addition, soils support plant growth which plays a major role in regulating air quality. The scale of the soil impacts on air quality range from global (e.g. greenhouse gas fluxes, stratospheric ozone depletion) to local (e.g. odours, particulates, pathogen transport). Harmful emissions from soil can be increased or decreased by anthropogenic activity, while climate change is likely to modify future emissions patterns, both directly and in response to human mitigation and adaption actions. Although soils are not the only source of these pollutants, it is worthwhile managing them to reduce erosion and nutrient losses to maintain soil health so we may continue to benefit from the contributions to good quality of life they provide. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of soils in delivering Nature's Contributions to People'.

J	Danovaro, R; Umani, SF; Pusceddu, A				Danovaro, Roberto; Umani, Serena Fonda; Pusceddu, Antonio			Climate Change and the Potential Spreading of Marine Mucilage and Microbial Pathogens in the Mediterranean Sea	PLOS ONE				Article								Background: Marine snow (small amorphous aggregates with colloidal properties) is present in all oceans of the world. Surface water warming and the consequent increase of water column stability can favour the coalescence of marine snow into marine mucilage, large marine aggregates representing an ephemeral and extreme habitat. Marine mucilage characterize aquatic systems with altered environmental conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated, by means of molecular techniques, viruses and prokaryotes within the mucilage and in surrounding seawater to examine the potential of mucilage to host new microbial diversity and/or spread marine diseases. We found that marine mucilage contained a large and unexpectedly exclusive microbial biodiversity and hosted pathogenic species that were absent in surrounding seawater. We also investigated the relationship between climate change and the frequency of mucilage in the Mediterranean Sea over the last 200 years and found that the number of mucilage outbreaks increased almost exponentially in the last 20 years. The increasing frequency of mucilage outbreaks is closely associated with the temperature anomalies. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that the spreading of mucilage in the Mediterranean Sea is linked to climate-driven sea surface warming. The mucilage can act as a controlling factor of microbial diversity across wide oceanic regions and could have the potential to act as a carrier of specific microorganisms, thereby increasing the spread of pathogenic bacteria.

Concurrently, outbreaks of novel plant pests and pathogens are multiplying with increased global trade network connectivity and larger volumes of imported plants, raising concerns that restoration plantings may act as introductory disease pathways. We used UK common juniper, subject since similar to 1995 to conservation plantings and now experiencing significant mortality from the non-native pathogen Phytophthora austrocedri Gresl. & E. M. Hansen, as an example species to explore the availability of monitoring data that could be used to assess disease risks posed by planting. We compiled spatial records of juniper planting including qualitative data on sources of planting material, propagation settings and organization types that managed planting projects. We found that juniper planting activity expanded every decade since 1990 across the UK and while not all planting resulted in outbreaks, 19% of P. austrocedri detections were found within 2 km of a known planting. We highlight the scale and diversity of organizations raising and planting juniper, as well as the lack of source material traceability, and suggest that cross-sector collaboration and changes in practice are required to reduce the risks of pathogen introduction posed by restoration planting.

Cockles live in estuaries and lagoons where their population is controlled by several environmental factors including parasitism. Parasites represent an important part of the world known biodiversity but are often neglected. Trematodes are the most prevalent macroparasites of cockles being able to exert an impact both at the individual and population levels. Therefore, it is of prime relevance to recognize and understand the parasite-host system dynamics in order to better predict potential conservation threats to bivalve populations and to maximize the success of stock and disease episodes management. Cockle monitoring was conducted in 2012 and 2016, in six and eight stations, respectively, at the Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon, Portugal. Cockles were sampled in one single occasion in 2012 and seasonally in 2016. The tested hypothesis is that the trematode community in cockles was spatially and seasonally heterogeneous but stable over time. The main result showed that despite a relative homogeneity of the parasite community structure in cockles, the among-years heterogeneity of trematode communities was higher than among-stations and among-seasons heterogeneity rejecting the postulated hypothesis. Results demonstrated that trematode communities from the Ria de Aveiro are characterized by low abundance, which resulted in a spatial and seasonal trematode homogeneity (despite an overall channel difference and a slight downstream-upstream gradient). The interannual analysis showed a worrisome loss of trematode diversity and prevalence which consequently indicates an important loss of overall diversity and/or environmental conditions reflecting the negative effects of global change (mean temperature rise and overharvesting, among others). The present study highlighted the importance of trematodes in characterising their associated environment and respective biodiversity which might be helpful to assess ecosystem ecological status and to identify threatened areas.

Fungal root endophytes influence plants in a species-specific manner that depends on plant's growth stage	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				Article								The mycobiome (fungal microbiome) influences plants-from seed germination to full maturation. While many studies on fungal-plant interaction studies have focused on known mutualistic and pathogenic fungi, the functional role of ubiquitous endophytic fungi remains little explored. We examined how root-inhabiting fungi (endophytes) influence range-expanding plant species. We isolated endophytes from three European intra-continental range-expanders and three congenerics that are native both in the range expander's original (southern Europe) and new (northern Europe) range. To standardize our collection, endophytes were obtained from all six plant species growing under controlled conditions in northern (new range of the range expander) and southern (native range of the range expander) soils. We cultivated, molecularly identified and tested the effects of all isolates on seed germination, and growth of seedlings and older plants. Most of the 34 isolates could not be functionally characterized based on their taxonomic identity and literature information on functions. Endophytes affected plant growth in a plant species-endophyte-specific manner, but overall differed between range-expanders and natives. While endophytes reduced germination and growth of range-expanders compared to natives, they reduced seedling growth of natives more than of range-expanders. Synthesis. We conclude that endophytic fungi have a direct effect on plant growth in a plant growth stage-dependent manner. While these effects differed between range expanders and natives, the effect strength and significance varied among the plant genera included in the present study. Nevertheless, endophytes likely influence the establishment of newly arriving plants and influence vegetation dynamics.	[Geisen, Stefan; ten Hooven, Freddy C.; Kostenko, Olga; Snoek, L.

J	Fonturbel, FE				Fonturbel, Francisco E.			Mistletoes in a changing world: a premonition of a non-analog future?	BOTANY				Article; Proceedings Paper	World Congress of the International-Union-of-Forest-Research-Organizations (IUFRO) / Symposium on Mistletoes	2019	Curitiba, BRAZIL					Mistletoes are a group of flowering plants that have developed a parasitic lifeform through complex eco-evolutionary processes. Despite being considered a pest, mistletoes represent a keystone forest resource and are involved in complex plant-plant and plant-animal interactions. Their parasitic lifeform and specialized ecological interactions make mistletoes an ideal model with which to understand the effects of anthropogenic disturbances in a changing world. The accelerated growth of the human population has altered all ecosystems on Earth, leading to biodiversity loss. Land-use changes (involving habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation, and transformation processes) can alter the ecological scenario for mistletoe by altering hosts, mutualists, and nutrient cycling. Those changes may have large consequences at the community level, changing the spatial structure of mistletoes, as well as interaction effectiveness, facilitation process, interaction disruption, and novel interactions with invasive species, leading to non-analog communities in the long run. Furthermore, climate change effects operate on a global scale, enhancing the effects of land-use changes. As temperatures increase, many species would alter their distribution and phenology, potentially causing spatial and temporal mismatches. But more critical is the fact that water stress is likely to disrupt key ecological interactions. Thus, mistletoes can provide valuable insights for what we can expect in the future, as a result of human disturbances.

J	Song, XY; Corlett, RT				Song, Xiaoyang; Corlett, Richard T.			Do natural enemies mediate conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence of trees? A meta-analysis of exclusion experiments	OIKOS				Article								Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is believed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides or exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence was more common at the seedling stage. Only 30% of studies showed significant conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence. Among those studies, applying fungicides significantly reduced the effect of conspecific negative distance-dependent mortality. Excluding large mammals reduced the effect of conspecifics, but with only marginal significance (p < 0.1). Our study confirms that plant pathogens have a significant impact on distance-dependent mortality and suggests that the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, appear to weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types, and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

HELMINTH DIVERSITY OF GREEN TREEFROGS (HYLA CINEREA) IN THEIR EXPANDED GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY				Article								There has been a growing interest in characterizing the parasite faunas of species populations as they expand their geographical ranges as a result of climate change. Expanded-range populations often exhibit lower parasite diversity than historical-range populations, and reduced parasitism may, in part, be attributable to expanded-range populations escaping their native range parasites. The present study compares the helminth faunas of green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) from 4 historical and 4 expanded-range populations to determine whether these latter populations have undergone parasite escape. Results of this study found relatively high degrees of similarity in species composition among helminth assemblages within historical or within range-expansion locations, with marked differences in the composition of helminth faunas between historical and expanded-range populations of these frogs. Because green treefrogs from expanded-range locations exhibited significant decreases in helminth species diversity compared with those from historical sites, they appear to be escaping levels of parasitism typically experienced by these frogs in their native range. Most notably, there was a decrease in the abundance of helminths with direct life cycles and the absence of trematode assemblages with indirect life cycles among expanded-range populations of H. cinerea. The low prevalence of trematode assemblages among historical populations of green treefrogs could limit these parasites' ability to be introduced and propagated in expanded-range locations. However, the lack of trematode assemblages among populations of H. cinerea in its expanded range may also be due to the absence or limited availability of other aquatic hosts that are required to complete the life cycles of these parasites. The reduction in helminth diversity among expanded-range populations of green treefrogs lends some credence to the notion that individuals at the front of a range expansion often invest less energy in reproduction and in doing so allocate more energy to dispersal and other life-history traits, including resistance to parasites. There may, however, be other explanations for differences in parasite species diversity between historical and expanded-range populations of H. cinerea. Because many of the helminths reported from this study are host generalists of amphibians whose recruitment and transmission among intermediate and paratenic hosts are known to be constrained by water and/or soil moisture conditions, we cannot ignore the role of both local amphibian diversity and local abiotic factors in influencing helminth diversity between the 2 population types of green treefrogs. These latter factors would decrease the role of parasite escape or energy trade-offs in driving helminth diversity among populations of H. cinerea and instead would suggest that local conditions play a more prominent role in structuring their helminth communities.

Climate change effects are accompanied by the increase in the presence of mycotoxins and various pathogens, which contribute to the reduction of the possibility of successfully producing Maize. In this framework, Proso Millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) may be an interesting alternative, as it is a relatively low-demanding crop, highly drought-resistant, and can be employed, similarly to Sorghum, in rotation, maintaining a certain amount of biodiversity and contributing to the revenue for the farmers. Moreover, Proso Millet has a very short cycle, and may be used as a catch crop, when other crops have failed or after their harvest. Millet used to be cultivated in ancient times in Italy, but then it was abandoned in favor of Maize, so now it is necessary to re-define proper agricultural practices and managements, as well as to remedy to the lack of an exact description of its phenological development. In the frame of a Life-CCA EU project, called Growing REsilience AgriculTure-Life (GREAT LIFE), aim of this work is to encode phenology of Proso Millet using BBCH scale. The lack of an exact definition of Proso Millet phenology is a major drawback in progressing in research on this crop, which could be a very valuable tool for improving the resilience of agro-ecosystems to climate change in the Mediterranean basin. For this purpose, Proso Millet was cultivated in two experimental sites in the Emilia-Romagna region (North of Italy). The crop was closely monitored throughout the life cycle, in order to document, even photographically, the achievement of the subsequent phenological phases (including the time necessary to reach each phenological stage, expressed as Days After Sowing-DAS). Thanks to weather data collection from agrometeorological stations close to the experimental fields, it was possible to correlate the phenological development to temperature-driven heat-unit accumulation (Cumulated Growing Degree Days-CGDD), using the single triangle method (useful tool for forecasting purposes). Ancillary agronomic data have also been collected, for completeness. This study well describes primary and secondary phenological stages of Proso Millet, managing at encoding them in the BBCH scale and contextually providing DAS and CGDD values necessary to achieve the different phenophases. The difference observed between the two experimental sites in reaching each BBCH stage according to both CGDD and DAS is mostly restrained, suggesting that this work may represent a valid first tool in defining the phenological development of Proso Millet in the areas of Northern Italy. The effort made to encode Proso Millet phenology in BBCH scale may be useful to give to researchers comprehensive indications for future agronomic surveys on the crop. The agronomic data collected show that the crop had a good agronomic performance despite the adverse weather pattern during the season, enlightening for farmers the opportunity offered by Millet in Italy as a resilient crop.

Changes in host-parasitoid food web structure with elevation	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				Article								1 .Gradients in elevation are increasingly used to investigate how species respond to changes in local climatic conditions. Whilst many studies have shown elevational patterns in species richness and turnover, little is known about how food web structure is affected by elevation. Contrasting responses of predator and prey species to elevation may lead to changes in food web structure. We investigated how the quantitative structure of a herbivore-parasitoid food web changes with elevation in an Australian subtropical rain forest. On four occasions, spread over 1year, we hand-collected leaf miners at twelve sites, along three elevational gradients (between 493m and 1159m a.s.l). A total of 5030 insects, including 603 parasitoids, were reared, and summary food webs were created for each site. We also carried out a replicated manipulative experiment by translocating an abundant leaf-mining weevil Platynotocis sp., which largely escaped parasitism at high elevations (900m a.s.l.), to lower, warmer elevations, to test if it would experience higher parasitism pressure. We found strong evidence that the environmental change that occurs with increasing elevation affects food web structure. Quantitative measures of generality, vulnerability and interaction evenness decreased significantly with increasing elevation (and decreasing temperature), whilst elevation did not have a significant effect on connectance. Mined plant composition also had a significant effect on generality and vulnerability, but not on interaction evenness. Several relatively abundant species of leaf miner appeared to escape parasitism at higher elevations, but contrary to our prediction, Platynotocis sp. did not experience greater levels of parasitism when translocated to lower elevations. Our study indicates that leaf-mining herbivores and their parasitoids respond differently to environmental conditions imposed by elevation, thus producing structural changes in their food webs. Increasing temperatures and changes in vegetation communities that are likely to result from climate change may have a restructuring effect on host-parasitoid food webs. Our translocation experiment, however, indicated that leaf miners currently escaping parasitism at high elevations may not automatically experience higher parasitism under warmer conditions and future changes in food web structure may depend on the ability of parasitoids to adapt to novel hosts.

Elevated atmospheric CO2 stimulates soil fungal diversity through increased fine root production in a semiarid shrubland ecosystem	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Soil fungal communities are likely to be central in mediating microbial feedbacks to climate change through their effects on soil carbon (C) storage, nutrient cycling, and plant health. Plants often produce increased fine root biomass in response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), but the responses of soil microbial communities are variable and uncertain, particularly in terms of species diversity. In this study, we describe the responses of the soil fungal community to free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) in a semiarid chaparral shrubland in Southern California (dominated by Adenomstoma fasciculatum) using large subunit rRNA gene sequencing. Community composition varied greatly over the landscape and responses to FACE were subtle, involving a few specific groups. Increased frequency of Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes, the latter including the Helotiales, a group that includes many dark septate endophytes known to associate positively with roots, was observed in the FACE plots. Fungal diversity, both in terms of richness and evenness, increased consistently in the FACE treatment, and was relatively high compared to other studies that used similar methods. Increases in diversity were observed across multiple phylogenetic levels, from genus to class, and were distributed broadly across fungal lineages. Diversity was also higher in samples collected close to (5 cm) plants compared to samples in canopy gaps (30 cm away from plants). Fungal biomass correlated well with soil organic matter (SOM) content, but patterns of diversity were correlated with fine root production rather than SOM. We conclude that the fungal community in this ecosystem is tightly linked to plant fine root production, and that future changes in the fungal community in response to elevated CO2 and other climatic changes will be primarily driven by changes in plant belowground allocation. Potential feedbacks mediated by soil fungi, such as soil C sequestration, nutrient cycling, and pathogenesis, are discussed.

J	Uemori, K; Mita, T; Hishi, T				Uemori, Kazushige; Mita, Toshiharu; Hishi, Takuo			Differences in functional trait responses to elevation among feeding guilds of Aculeata community	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Article								The response of communities to environmental change is expected to vary among feeding guilds. To evaluate the response of guilds to environmental factors without considering the taxonomic specificities, it is useful to examine Aculeata bees and wasps, which consist of closely related taxa including different guilds, pollinators, predators, and parasitoids. In this study, we evaluated changes in species diversity (SD) and functional traits of each feeding guild along an elevational gradient in a boreal forest in northern Japan. We used yellow pan traps to collect Aculeata bees and wasps at 200-1600 m above sea level. We investigated six functional traits (trophic level, seasonal duration, body size, elevational range, nesting position, and soil dependency) and the horizontal distribution of the species. The SD of all Aculeata, predators, and parasitoids decreased with an increase in elevation; however, the SD of pollinators did not show any specific trend. Although the functional trait composition of all Aculeata species did not show any trend, that of each feeding guild responded to elevation in different ways. Pollinators increased in body size and showed a decrease in seasonal duration with increasing elevation, suggesting that tolerance and seasonal escape from physical stress at high elevations are important for shaping pollinator communities. Predators increased their elevational range and the proportion of above-ground nesting species increased with increasing elevation, suggesting that the ability to live in a wider range of environments and avoid unsuitable soil environments at high elevations might be important. Parasitoids changed their hosts and displayed variable traits with increasing elevation, suggesting that brood parasitoids have difficulty in surviving at high elevation. The traits for each guild responded in different ways, even if they were dominated by the same environmental factors. Our findings imply that differences in the responses of functional traits would produce different community assembly patterns in different guilds during further climate change.

A Review of Bee Captures in Pest Monitoring Traps and Future Directions for Research and Collaboration	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT				Review								Bees provide an important ecosystem service by contributing to the pollination of crop and wild plant species. Multiple bee species, however, are in decline due to factors such as habitat loss and fragmentation, inadequate food availability, improper management practices, climate change, and pressures from pathogens and pests, including exotic species. Concerns about pollinator declines and implications for ecosystem services have led to efforts to create and restore pollinator habitat, refine pest management practices, improve detection of pests and exotic species that threaten native bees, and monitor populations to identify and protect vulnerable bee species and communities. A variety of methods are used to monitor bee populations, some of which use visual stimuli that mimic natural cues used to locate floral resources. Bees also find their way into traps that use both visual and olfactory cues to attract pest insects. On one hand, researchers work to improve pest monitoring tools to increase target captures and reduce bee bycatch. On the other, analysis of bee bycatch can help assess biodiversity, determine population fluctuations and range expansions or contractions, support monitoring efforts, and identify patterns and processes of broader ecological interest. These different fields of research should not be seen as conflicting goals, but rather an opportunity for greater complementarity and collaboration. This article reviews the biological and ecological bases for bee attraction to traps, summarizes recent trends in bycatch research, highlights future research priorities, and identifies opportunities for collaborative data sharing to maximize existing resources.

J	Duru, M; Le Bras, C				Duru, Michel; Le Bras, Claire			Environmental and health crises: Anthropocene diseases that call for redesigning our food system	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES				Review								Since the middle of the 20th century, the impacts of human activities on ecosystems have been increasing. The erosion of biodiversity and climate change, as well as the pandemics of obesity and diabetes, are now compounded by the coronavirus pandemic. This is a set of environmental or health crises resulting in part from common factors and whose impacts can be combined and amplified. In this new context, our methods of food production, processing, distribution and consumption are particularly questioned. They are the source of a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions, participate in the destruction of some natural habitats which are reservoirs of pathogens, and contribute to the emergence of human chronic diseases. As a result, the need for a transition in our food system is a shared idea, even if the choice of the changes to be made concretely raises many questions. Through a systemic approach to "global health", reflecting the interdependence of the state of health of humans, animals, and the ecosystems in which they evolve, we show that synergies must be found between practices allowing to face environmental and health challenges. We show that it is possible to make doubly virtuous choices for the environment and health by transforming the modes of production, processing, distribution and consumption of food: reorienting animal husbandry, lowering the degree of food processing, diversifying distribution methods and increasing plant food. These changes contribute to set up territorialized food systems.

Beyond the exposure to environmental hazards, conditions such as environmental degradation, biotic impoverishment, climate change, and the loss of ecosystem services create important health threats by changing the ecology of many pathogens and increasing the incidence and/ or severity of certain noncommunicable conditions. They also threaten health in the future by weakening the Earth's life support systems. Although physicians remain one of the most often accessed and most trusted sources of information about the environment, there is currently little emphasis on educating medical professionals about these environmental issues. This lack of training reduces the ability of most physicians to be efficient science-public interfaces and makes them ineffective at contributing to address the fundamental causes of environmental problems or participate in substantive environmental policy discussions. This is an important challenge facing medical education today. To turn medical students into effective physician-citizens, an already-overwhelmed medical school curriculum must make way for a thoughtful exploration of environmental stressors and their impacts on human health. The overarching question before medical educators is how to develop the competencies, standards, and curricula for this educational endeavor. To this end, the authors highlight some of the critical linkages between health and the environment and suggest a subset of key practical issues that need to be addressed in order to create environmental education standards for the physician of the future.

Numerous causes have been invoked to explain these declines. These include habitat destruction, climate change, increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation, environmental contamination, and the introduction of non-native species and diseases. Several types of pathogens have been implicated in contributing to amphibian population declines: viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. One particular fungus, the chytridiomycete Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis may have caused amphibian population declines in several regions. This pathogen causes chytridiomycosis, which is fatal to newly,metamorphic and adult amphibians of certain species. We present experimental evidence that larval stages may also be susceptible to exposure to Batrachochytrium. There was, however, differential sensitivity to B. dendrobatidis in larvae we examined. In laboratory experiments, larval western toads (Bufo boreas) exposed to B. dendrobatidis experienced increased mortality and behaviors that suggested they were affected by exposure compared with unexposed control tadpoles. Larvae of Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae), bullfrogs (R. catesbeiana), and Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla) did not die after exposure to Batrachochytrium and appeared to behave normally. R. cascadae larvae exposed to B. dendrobatidis, however showed an increase incidence in mouthpart abnormalities, a characteristic effect of chytridiomycosis, compared with unexposed controls. These results show that Batrachochytrium can negatively affect some species of amphibians at the larval stage and not others. The implications of interspecific variation in susceptibility to fungal infection are broad.

Here, we show that tree mortality concomitant with drought has led to short-term (mean 5 y, range 1 to 23 y after mortality) vegetation-type conversion in multiple biomes across the world (131 sites). Self-replacement of the dominant tree species was only prevalent in 21% of the examined cases and forests and woodlands shifted to nonwoody vegetation in 10% of them. The ultimate temporal persistence of such changes remains unknown but, given the key role of biological legacies in long-term ecological succession, this emerging picture of postdrought ecological trajectories highlights the potential for major ecosystem reorganization in the coming decades. Community changes were less pronounced under wetter postmortality conditions. Replacement was also influenced by management intensity, and postdrought shrub dominance was higher when pathogens acted as codrivers of tree mortality. Early change in community composition indicates that forests dominated by mesic species generally shifted toward more xeric communities, with replacing tree and shrub species exhibiting drier bioclimatic optima and distribution ranges. However, shifts toward more mesic communities also occurred and multiple pathways of forest replacement were observed for some species. Drought characteristics, species-specific environmental preferences, plant traits, and ecosystem legacies govern post drought species turnover and subsequent ecological trajectories, with potential far-reaching implications for forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.

This study area comprises a rural valley with unique geographical and climatological conditions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to quantify and determine its fungal diversity, so this knowledge will contribute to detect potential pathogenic and toxic fungi that has been adapted to this type of environment and may overcome the incipient climate change. Samplings were conducted in two geographical zones of the study area and a microflow air sampler was used to isolate fungal taxa. The annual mean fungal counts were found in the order of E+03 CFU/m(3) of air. The aerial mycoflora revealed a wide biodiversity of at least 28 genera and 50 fungal species. Cladosporium was the most abundant genus (76.97%), followed by Alternaria (12.48%), Epicoccum (4.41%) and Botrytis (1.81%). The rest of the genera were found in relative densities lower than 1%. In terms of species, C. cladosporioides (34.82%), C. limoniforme (21.72%), A. tenuissima (10.94%) and C. asperulatum predominated (9.01%). This is the first report of the air mycoflora of rural environments with cold dry desert climate which provides useful information to take preventive measures to avoid biological damage.

J	Ennos, R; Cottrell, J; Hall, J; O'Brien, D				Ennos, Richard; Cottrell, Joan; Hall, Jeanette; O'Brien, David			Is the introduction of novel exotic forest tree species a rational response to rapid environmental change? - A British perspective	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				Review								Both plantation forests and native woodlands are currently facing challenges in the form of rapid climatic change and unprecedented increases in damage by exotic pests and diseases. To combat these problems it has been proposed that a range of novel exotic tree species (non-native species that have not yet undergone thorough operational testing or previously been grown at a forestry scale) should be grown as part of an adaptive management strategy, and that non-native (including novel) species should be introduced into native woodland. Justifications for this policy are that novel exotic species are required to maintain forest productivity under climate change, to create a more diverse, and by implication more resilient forest, and to substitute for native species threatened by introduced pests and pathogens. Here we examine these arguments in the context of British forestry, where there is a long history of utilising non-native species. On the basis of this documented experience we conclude that in the commercial sector of British forestry, where production is the main objective, there are strong arguments for undertaking a programme of rigorous testing and domestication of a very limited number of the most promising novel exotics which, in addition to good timber and growth, also have attributes that will allow the development of more naturalistic silvicultural systems and a move away from current clear-fell regimes. However this must be undertaken within a comprehensive risk assessment framework, where candidate species are rigorously screened both for any biosecurity threats, and their potential for causing ecological damage if they become invasive outside their initial planting sites. Widespread planting of candidate species should only be recommended after the completion of full species and provenance trials, and when reliable sources of appropriately adapted seed have been established. Conversely where conservation of biodiversity is an objective we find no support for introduction of any non-native species. This is based on the greater ecological and economic risk they pose compared to the use of native species. Use of non-natives is likely to lead to an increase rather than a decrease in pest and disease problems, and to hinder rather than support the retention of threatened native tree species and their associated biodiversity.

Parasitic flowering plant collections embody the extended specimen	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Review; Early Access								The widespread digitization of natural history collections, combined with novel tools and approaches is revolutionizing biodiversity science. The 'extended specimen' concept advocates a more holistic approach in which a specimen is framed as a diverse stream of interconnected data. Herbarium specimens that by their very nature capture multispecies relationships, such as certain parasites, fungi and lichens, hold great potential to provide a broader and more integrative view of the ecology and evolution of symbiotic interactions. This particularly applies to parasite-host associations, which owing to their interconnectedness are especially vulnerable to global environmental change. Here, we present an overview of how parasitic flowering plants is represented in herbarium collections. We then discuss the variety of data that can be gathered from parasitic plant specimens, and how they can be used to understand global change impacts at multiple scales. Finally, we review best practices for sampling parasitic plants in the field, and subsequently preparing and digitizing these specimens. Plant parasitism has evolved 12 times within angiosperms, and similar to other plant taxa, herbarium collections represent the foundation for analysing key aspects of their ecology and evolution. Yet these collections hold far greater potential. Data and metadata obtained from parasitic plant specimens can inform analyses of co-distribution patterns, changes in eco-physiology and species plasticity spanning temporal and spatial scales, chemical ecology of tripartite interactions (e.g. host-parasite-herbivore), and molecular data critical for species conservation. Moreover, owing to the historic nature and sheer size of global herbarium collections, these data provide the spatiotemporal breadth essential for investigating organismal response to global change. Parasitic plant specimens are primed to serve as ideal examples of extended specimen concept and help motivate the next generation of creative and impactful collection-based science. Continued digitization efforts and improved curatorial practices will contribute to opening these specimens to a broader audience, allowing integrative research spanning multiple domains and offering novel opportunities for education.

J	Everard, M; Johnston, P; Santillo, D; Staddon, C				Everard, Mark; Johnston, Paul; Santillo, David; Staddon, Chad			The role of ecosystems in mitigation and management of Covid-19 and other zoonoses	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY				Article								There is rising international concern about the zoonotic origins of many global pandemics. Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases; and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the 'biodiversity crisis'. This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations.

J	Danielopol, DL; Griebler, C; Gunatilaka, A; Notenboom, J				Danielopol, DL; Griebler, C; Gunatilaka, A; Notenboom, J			Present state and future prospects for groundwater ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION				Review								Ecological and socioeconomic aspects of subterranean hydrosystems have changed during the past 40-50 years. The major environmental pressures (mainly anthropogenic ones) impact the quantity and quality of groundwater resources and the state of subsurface ecosystems, and it is expected that the environmental pressures on groundwater will continue, at least until 2025, unless new environmental policies change this state of affairs. The world demographic increase and the general rise of water demand constitute one of the major environmental pressures on groundwater ecosystems especially in less developed countries in Africa, Asia and South America. Specific human activities leading to the depletion of groundwater reserves include agricultural practices, landscape alteration, urbanization demand for domestic and public drinking water, various industrial activities such as thermoelectric production and mining, and the rise of tourism in coastal areas. Climate change is contributing to the water crisis too, especially in areas with and climate and/or in some humid monsoonal countries. The overload of aquifers with pollutants derived from agriculture (fertilizers and pesticides), from industry (release of hydrocarbon chemicals, especially spills), from waste and industrial waters, from domestic and industrial landfills, from the infiltration of pollutants from surface and from the intrusion of saline water affect groundwater quality. The dangerous increase in contaminated subsurface sites with chemicals and microbial pathogens brings with it health risks to humans. Changes of redox condition in groundwater zones, changes of biological diversity, vegetation changes with modification of agriculture practices and impacts at the biosphere scale, such as the increase in the concentration of nitrous oxides in the atmosphere, all impact groundwater ecosystems. Groundwater ecosystems must be better investigated and understood. Economic, social and ecological lines of thinking have to be combined in order to achieve meaningful policies for the sustainable development of groundwater reserves and for the protection of subsurface ecosystems. Practical measures and ideas for the development of policies up to the 2025 time-horizon should improve the sustainable usage of the world's groundwater resources.

However, the health of bumble bees is threatened by multiple factors: habitat loss, climate change, pesticide use, and disease caused by pathogens and parasites. It is therefore vitally important to have a fully developed phylogeny for bumble bee species as part of our conservation efforts. The purpose of this study was to explore the phylogenetic relationships of the dominant bumble bees on the Tibetan plateau and in northern China as well as their placement and classification within the genus Bombus. The study used combined gene analysis consisting of sequence fragments from six genes, 16S rRNA, COI, EF-1 alpha, Argk, Opsin and PEPCK, and the phylogenetic relationships of 209 Bombus species were explored. Twenty-six species, including 152 gene sequences, were collected from different regions throughout China, and 1037 gene sequences representing 183 species were obtained from GenBank or BOLD. The results suggest that the 209 analyzed species belong to fifteen subgenera and that most of the subgenera in Bornbus are monophyletic, which is in accordance with conventional morphology-based classifications. The phylogenetic trees also show that nearly all subgenera easily fall into two distinct clades: short-faced and long-faced. The study is the first to investigate the phylogenetic placement of Bombus turneri (Richards), Bombus opulent us Smith, Bombus pyrosoma Morawitz, Bombus longipennis Friese, Bombus minshanensis Bischoff, and Bombus lantschouensis Vogt, all of which are widely distributed throughout different regions of China. The knowledge and understanding gained from the findings can provide a molecular basis to accurately classify Bombus in China and to define strategies to conserve biodiversity and promote pollinator populations.

J	Lazaro-Lobo, A; Ervin, GN				Lazaro-Lobo, Adrian; Ervin, Gary N.			Wetland Invasion: a Multi-Faceted Challenge during a Time of Rapid Global Change	WETLANDS				Article								Wetlands are unique, highly biodiverse ecosystems of high conservation value that provide multiple ecosystem services to human society. However, the dynamic nature of wetlands creates abundant opportunities for the establishment and spread of invasive species, especially those well adapted to the current global prevalence of environmental change. Wetland invasibility is influenced by ongoing changes in climate and human land use (e.g., hydrologic modifications and eutrophication). Invasive species, in turn, can change the community composition and structure of the colonized wetlands through direct competition, predation, habitat alterations, hybridization, and pathogen transmission. Invaders can also alter ecosystem functioning, including hydrology, sedimentation, fire regimes, food webs, nutrient cycling, and succession. These changes in the biotic community and ecosystem functioning can affect human derived wetland services such as navigation, water distribution, and resource provision, as well as exaggerate problems related to human health. Although we currently possess diverse tools for managing individual species invasions, the current rate of global change may require creative approaches to achieve management success in the near future. Single-species or single-parameter approaches are unlikely to provide sustained biodiversity protection in this time of unprecedented environmental change, and hierarchical or multi-stressor approaches may become the new norm for managing wetland invasion.

J	Subbotina, EL; Loktev, VB				Subbotina, E. L.; Loktev, V. B.			Molecular Evolution of the Tick-Borne Encephalitis and Powassan Viruses	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				Article								Issues associated with newly emerging viruses, their genetic diversity, and viral evolution in modern environments are currently attracting growing attention. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis was performed and the evolution rate was evaluated for such pathogenic flaviviruses endemic to Russia as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Powassan virus (PV). The analysis involved 47 nucleotide sequences of the TBEV genome region encoding protein E and 17 sequences of the PV NS5-encoding region. The nucleotide substitution rate was estimated as 1.4 x 10(-4) and 5.4 x 10(-5) substitutions per site per year for the E protein-encoding region of the TBEV genome and for the NS5 genome region of PV, respectively. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS) in viral sequences was calculated as 0.049 for TBEV and 0.098 for PV. The highest dN/dS values of 0.201-0.220 were found in the subcluster of Russian and Canadian PV strains, and the lowest value of 0.024 was observed in the cluster of Russian and Chinese strains of the Far Eastern TBEV genotype. Evaluation of time intervals between the events of viral evolution showed that the European subtype of TBEV diverged from the common TBEV ancestor approximately 2750 years ago, while the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes emerged approximately 2250 years ago. The PV was introduced into its natural foci of the Russian Primorskii krai only approximately 70 years ago; these strains were very close to Canadian PV strains. The pattern of PV evolution in North America was similar to the evolution of the Siberian and Far Eastern TBEV subtypes in Asia. The moments of divergence between major genetic groups of TBEV and PV coincide with historical periods of climate warming and cooling, suggesting that climate change was a key factor in the evolution of flaviviruses in past millennia.

Transcriptional Profiling of the Oral Pathogen Streptococcus mutans in Response to Competence Signaling Peptide XIP	MSYSTEMS				Article								In the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans, competence development is regulated by the ComRS signaling system comprised of the ComR regulator and the ComS prepeptide to the competence signaling peptide XIP (ComX-inducing peptide). Aside from competence development, XIP signaling has been demonstrated to regulate cell lysis, and recently, the expression of bacteriocins, small antimicrobial peptides used by bacteria to inhibit closely related species. Our study further explores the effect of XIP signaling on the S. mutans transcriptome. RNA sequencing revealed that XIP induction resulted in a global change in gene expression that was consistent with a stress response. An increase in several membrane-bound regulators, including HdrRM and BrsRM, involved in bacteriocin production, and the VicRKX system, involved in acid tolerance and biofilm formation, was observed. Furthermore, global changes in gene expression corresponded to changes observed during the stringent response to amino acid starvation. Effects were also observed on genes involved in sugar transport and carbon catabolite repression and included the levQRST and levDEFG operons. Finally, our work identified a novel heat shock-responsive intergenic region, encoding a small RNA, with a potential role in competence shutoff. IMPORTANCE Genetic competence provides bacteria with an opportunity to increase genetic diversity or acquire novel traits conferring a survival advantage. In the cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans, DNA transformation is regulated by the competence stimulating peptide XIP (ComX-inducing peptide). The present study utilizes high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to provide a greater understanding of how global gene expression patterns change in response to XIP. Overall, our work demonstrates that in S. mutans, XIP signaling induces a response that resembles the stringent response to amino acid starvation.

Together, our results provide further evidence that multiple stress response mechanisms are linked through the genetic competence signaling pathway in S. mutans.

Therefore, the health condition of scleractinian corals is an essential factor for the sustainability of coral reef ecosystems. Recent studies indicate that global warming, seawater acidification as well as coral diseases are the main threats to scleractinian corals. In addition, coral endoparasites may impact the health of scleractinian corals by consuming coral tissues and potentially transferring disease pathogens. However, we have limited knowledge about the distributions of coral endoparasites across scleractinian corals. It may lead to the assessment bias on the health condition of the coral reef community due to no consideration on the impact of the interaction between corals and their endoparasites. Here, we performed an elaborate survey on a widely distributed scleractinian coral species, Psammocora columna, and discovered two new parasitic copepod species, Xarifia yanliaoensis and Xarifia magnifica. We also summarized a classification key of morphological characteristics for the identification of Xarifia copepods in Psammocora corals. The findings of this study present new records of copepod-coral relationships in the Indo-West Pacific for the biological resource database. Furthermore, these are the footstone knowledge for further studies on coral reef conservation.</p> A comprehensive knowledge of relationships between coral and coral-associated organisms is essential for the conservation studies of the coral reef community, yet the biodiversity database of coral-inhabiting copepods remains incomplete. Here we surveyed in a widely distributed scleractinian coral, Psammocora columna Dana, 1846, and newly discovered two endoparasitic copepod species, Xarifia yanliaoensis sp. nov. and Xarifia magnifica sp. nov. These two new species are described based on specimens collected in Taiwan, and they share several common morphological characters of Xarifia copepods, i.e., region dorsal to fifth legs having three posteriorly directed processes unequally. However, X. yanliaoensis sp. nov. is distinguishable from other species by the morphology of the endopods of legs, antenna, maxilla, and maxilliped (in both genders). The morphological characters of X. magnifica sp. nov. are the endopods of legs, leg 5, and maxilliped in the male. Including the two new species described in the present work, the genus Xarifia Humes, 1960 belongs to the cyclopoid family Xarifiidae Humes, 1960 currently consists of 94 species, and eight of them live in association with the Psammocora coral. A comparison table and a key to the species of Xarifia from Psammocora corals are given herein.</p>	[Cheng, Yu-Rong] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Fisheries Prod & Management, 142 Haijhuan Rd, Kaohsiung 811213, Taiwan; [Lu, Tsai-Ming] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, 128 Acad Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 115024, Taiwan; [Ding, De-Sing] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Hydrosphere Sci, PhD Program Aquat Sci & Technol Ind, 142 Haijhuan Rd, Kaohsiung 811213, Taiwan		Cheng, YR (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Fisheries Prod & Management, 142 Haijhuan Rd, Kaohsiung 811213, Taiwan.	yrcheng@nkust.edu.tw; tmlu@gate.sinica.edu.tw; 1041750102@nkust.edu.tw								0	0											OCT	2021	11	10							2847	10.3390/ani11102847	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11102847				Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology				34679869				2023-09-28	WOS:000717152100001
J	Swynghedauw, B				Swynghedauw, Bernard			Medical consequences of global warming	PRESSE MEDICALE				Review								Introduction > The global warming of the planet and its anthropogenic origin ore no longer debatable. Nevertheless, from a medical point of view, while the epidemiological consequences of the warming are rather well-known, the biological consequences ore still poorly documented. This is a good example of evolutionary (or darwinian) medicine. Methods > The research strategy of this systematic review is based on both PubMed during the period of 2000-2007 and several reviews articles for the period > 2000. Results > From a medical point of view, there ore four types of consequences. 1-The simple elevation of the average external temperature is accompanied by on increased global mortality and morbidity, the mortality/external temperature is a J curve, with the worm branch more pronounced than the cold one. A recent study on 50 different cities had confirmed that global, and more specifically cardiovascular mortalities were enhanced at the two extreme of the temperatures. 2-The acute heatwaves, such as that which happened in France in August 2003, hove been studied in detail by several groups. The mortality which was observed during the recent heatwaves was not compensated by harvesting, strongly suggesting that we were dealing with heat stroke, and that such an increased mortality was more reflecting the limits of our adaptational capacities than aggravation of a previously altered health status. 3-Climate changes have modified the repartition and virulence of pathogenic agents (dengue, malaria...) and above all their vectors. Such modifications were exponential and ore likely to reflect the biological properties of parasites. 4-Indirect consequences of global worming include variations in the hydraulic cycle, the new form of tropical hurricanes and many different changes affecting both biodiversity and ecosystems. They will likely result in on increased level of poverty. Discussion > These finding gave rise to several basic biological questions, rarely evoked, and that concern the limits of the adaptational capacities of human genome. our genome has indeed been shaped in the post by a rather cold environment which has acutely been modified. The immediate physiological regulation includes sweating and skin vasodilatation. The latter may strongly enhance the cardiac output which explains the heat-induced cardiac decompensation. Long term regulation depends upon the numerous mechanisms of uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiration. For the moment, the thermolytic mechanisms and their regulation were rather poorly documented.

AREA-WIDE MANAGEMENT OF RICE PLANTHOPPER PESTS IN ASIA THROUGH INTEGRATION OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES	AREA-WIDE INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT: Development and Field Application				Article; Book Chapter								Most rice insect pests are exogenous immigrants from either long distances or neighbouring areas. For their management to be economical and sustainable, an area-wide perspective is imperative. Key pests, like the planthoppers and stem borers, are highly dependent on rice for survival and reproduction. They multiply and move from one rice crop to another, sometimes carrying virus diseases such as ragged stunt, grassy stunt and rice stripe from source areas. The planthoppers are r strategists, unable to overwinter in northern China, Japan and Korea, and are known to "migrate" or are displaced by wind from southern China to temperate regions of China, Japan and the Korean peninsula. With adequate faunal biodiversity and biological control ecosystem services in a rice crop, immigrant pests have low chances of survival and growth capacities, and often remain a minor pest. However, when the local ecosystem services are compromised, often by unnecessary insecticide use or extreme weather conditions, such as droughts or floods, the immigrants show high survival and growth rates. Since, 2008 the Rice Bowl of Thailand suffered brown planthopper (BPH) (Nilaparvata lugens Stal) outbreaks for 14 consecutive rice seasons that caused losses of more than USD 200 million. Farmers were routinely applying insecticides as prophylactics and the BPH consequently "escaped" its natural control and populations increased 100 000-fold. Ecological engineering approaches involve practices that will build and restore biodiversity and ecosystem services, and reduce insecticide-induced threats to ecosystem services. An area-wide increase in floral biodiversity in the crop landscape provides shelter, nectar, alternate hosts and pollen (abbreviated as SNAP by Professor Wratten) to conserve the natural enemy fauna. Pioneered in Jin Hua, China with sesame plants grown on the rice bunds, ecological engineering is now practiced in China, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, using several flower species. A multi-country, multi-year field trial conducted by scientists of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in collaboration with researchers from Australia, China, Thailand and Viet Nam showed that the growing of flowers on rice bunds as an ecological engineering practice increased profits (by 7.5%), yields (by 5%), biological control (by 45%) and added aesthetic values to the rural landscape. At the same time the ecological engineering practice decreased insecticide use (by 70%), pest densities (by 30%) and farmers' chemical input costs (by 70%). Farmers are adopters and implementers of ecological engineering practices, and to reach and motivate the millions of farmers in Viet Nam, two TV serials developed using entertainment-education principles were launched to promote the establishment of flower strips and to reduce insecticide applications. The TV serials helped farmers to "see" and appreciate the role of parasitoids by linking these (termed locally as "small bees") to widely-known bees. Farmers that viewed the serials decreased their insecticide use by 24%, had 3.3% higher yields, increased their appreciation of parasitoids and gained positive attitudes towards the establishment of flower strips. To achieve sustainable area-wide pest management, ecological engineering practices have to be coupled with rational pesticide management through better pesticide policies, regulations and implementation, accurate pest diagnostics and timely professional advice to farmers. Aside from its proven impacts on pest control and more profitable farming, increasing biodiversity and ecosystem services in rice fields can also contribute towards climate change adaptation and a more resilient environment.

Environmental determinants of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and the likelihood of further dispersion in the face of climate change in Texas, USA	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS				Article								One of the major drivers of amphibian population declines is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We sought to identify the major environmental drivers of Bd prevalence in Texas, USA, by drawing results from museum specimens. We sampled one of the largest museum collections in Texas, the Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections at Texas A&M University. Our sampling focused on the 9 amphibian species with the widest geographical distribution within the state, where we sub-sampled 30% of each species per decade from 1930 to present via skin swabs, totaling 1501 independent sampling events, and used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect pathogen presence. We analyzed several geo-referenced variables describing climatic conditions to identify potential factors influencing the likelihood of presence of Bd using boosted regression trees. Our final model suggests the most influential variables are mean temperature of driest quarter, annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, and mean diurnal range. The most likely suitable range for Bd is currently found in the Blackland Prairie and Cross Timbers ecoregions. Results of our future (to the year 2040) projections suggest that Bd could expand its current distribution. Our model could play an important role when developing an integrated conservation plan through (1) focusing future field work on locations with a high likelihood of presence, (2) assisting in the choice of locations for restoration, and (3) developing future research plans including those necessary for projecting reactions to climate change. Our model also could integrate new presence data of Bd when they become available to enhance prediction precision.	[Villamizar-Gomez, Andrea; Forstner, Michael R.

BOTANY LETTERS				Article								Ambrosia trifida L. (giant ragweed, Asteraceae) is native to the North American continent and was introduced into Europe and Asia at the end of the 19(th) century. In its native range, this tall annual species is common in riparian and ruderal habitats and is also a major weed in annual cropping systems. For nearly a century, A. trifida has also been of great concern in the U.S. for its highly allergenic pollen, necessitating targeted control measures to reduce its impact on human populations. Based on the distribution of A. trifida in North America and in its introduced range, riparian systems in the rest of the world may be particularly at risk to invasion, with potential negative consequences for their biodiversity. Currently, A. trifida has invaded Asia more widely than Europe, likely due to the more favourable local conditions in Asia. Throughout its introduced range, A. trifida is host to a limited number of invertebrates and pathogens and only a few biological agents are available for its control. The main impacts of A. trifida at a global level are on crop yield and human health, resulting in significant socio-economic impacts. The success of A. trifida invasion in areas in which it has been introduced is still unclear, but climate change may increase climate suitability, increasing the potential for A. trifida to spread. While effective management in cultivated fields seems potentially possible, the development and control of A. trifida in natural riparian habitats is of great concern due to the difficulty of management in these areas.

J	Fernandez-Delgado, C				Fernandez-Delgado, Carlos			Donana Natural Space: The Uncertain Future of a Crown Jewel in Europe's Protected Areas	CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT				Article								The Donana Natural Space (National and Natural Park) has three dominant ecosystems: dunes, beaches, and marshes. Its geographical position gives rise to a rich biota at a major stopover point in birds' migration routes and at a very important site for wintering waterfowl. Because of this, Donana has acquired the highest protected area categories that a natural area can receive from international conservation organizations. Yet Donana's ability to support biodiversity is under constant threat due to its proximity to culturally and economically critical locations. The greatest external problems center on agriculture and tourism, which extract enormous amounts of groundwater which then alter hydrological dynamics. Excessive nutrients, roads, commercial navigation, pilgrimages, and several programed projects are additional pressures that could be aggravated by climate change. Inside the Space, overpopulations of domestic and wild ungulates, pathogens, and invasive species have changed its ecology. Donana is managed by two operational programs implemented by a committee of 60 stakeholders. Both areas have been divided into conservation zones and very recently have been included in an extension of the old Biosphere Reserve with a Core Area (National Park), a Buffer Area (Natural Park), and a Transition Area. In the past 40 years, Donana has received about US$900 million: this has increased not only conservation efforts in the area but also the economic level of local residents. Conflicts are lessening but pressures are mounting. More collaboration between administrations, more active local participation, more firmness concerning illegal activities, more expert technical advice, and more funding will be needed in the near future to preserve this unique natural heritage.

J	Caruso, NM; Lips, KR				Caruso, Nicholas M.; Lips, Karen R.			Truly enigmatic declines in terrestrial salamander populations in Great Smoky Mountains National Park	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				Article								Aim Woodland salamanders (genus: Plethodon) declined synchronously across many protected areas in Eastern North America by the mid-1980s, but no cause was attributed to these declines. We hypothesized that the rapid, synchronous loss of several populations of many species was consistent with the invasive pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd), and we resurveyed historic sites to search for Bd in current populations. Location Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Methods We surveyed 35 sites 24 times between March and November 2009, quantified community composition and abundance of 72 populations of six species and three hybrids of Plethodon salamanders, and collected 665 skin swabs to detect Bd. Results At 22 of the 35 sites, we were unable to find one or more species that were historically present. Plethodon glutinosus and P. teyahalee and their hybrids were less abundant than historically found, P. jordani x metcalfi and P. ventralis were more abundant and the remaining three species fluctuated but showed no net change. Yet, only one of the 665 salamanders was positive for Bd. Main conclusions Declines were not associated with particular localities, but occurred in particular species. We conclude that over collecting, logging, and acid rain are unlikely to have caused these population declines, but we were unable to rule out disease or climate change as contributing factors. Population declines of Plethodon salamanders in the Park are substantial and have persisted for 30 years. Determining the cause and the extent of these declines is important for managing this area of global salamander biodiversity.

Enemies mediate distance- and density-dependent mortality of tree seeds and seedlings: a meta-analysis of fungicide, insecticide and exclosure studies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				Article								Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is often assumed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides and exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that distance- and density-dependent mortality caused by natural enemies was most likely at the seedling stage and was greater at higher mean annual temperatures. Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence at the seedling stage is significantly weakened when fungicides were applied. By contrast, negative conspecific distance- and density-dependence is not a general pattern at the seed stage. High seed mass reduced distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seed stage. Seed studies excluding only large mammals found significant negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality, but exclusion of all mammals resulted in a non-significant effect of conspecifics. Our study suggests that plant pathogens are a major cause of distance- and density-dependent mortality at the seedling stage, while the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

J	Coley, PD				Coley, PD			Possible effects of climate change on plant/herbivore interactions in moist tropical forests	CLIMATIC CHANGE				Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Tropical Forest Ecosystems	APR 24-28, 1995	SAN JUAN, PR					The interactions between plants and herbivores are key determinants of community structure world wide. Their role is particularly important in lowland tropical rain forests where rates of herbivory are higher, plants are better defended chemically and physically, and herbivores have specialized diets. In contrast to the temperate zone, most of the herbivory in the tropics occurs on ephemeral young leaves (>70%), which requires herbivores to have finely tuned host-finding abilities. As a consequence of these tight ecological and evolutionary linkages, the interplay between plants and herbivores in the tropics may be more susceptible to perturbations of climate change. Increases in global temperature, atmospheric CO2, and the length of the dry season are all likely to have ramifications for plant/herbivore interactions in the tropics. Here I extrapolate from our current and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating plant/herbivore interactions and present a scenario for possible trends under a changing climate. Although elevated CO2 tends to enhance plant growth rates, the larger effects of increased drought stress will probably result in lower growth. In atmospheres experimentally enriched in CO2, the nutritional quality of leaves declines substantially due to a dilution of nitrogen by 10-30%. This response is buffered in plant species associated with nitrogen fixers. Elevated CO2 should also cause a slight decrease in nitrogen-based defenses(e.g., alkaloids) and a slight increase in carbon-based defenses (e.g., tannins). The most dramatic and robust predicted effect of climate change is on rates of herbivory. Lower foliar nitrogen due to CO2 fertilization of plants causes an increase in consumption per herbivore by as much as 40% and unusually severe drought appears to cause herbivore populations to explode. In areas where elevated CO2 is combined with drying, rates of herbivory may rise 2-4 fold. The frequency of insect outbreaks is also expected to increase. Higher herbivory should further reduce plant growth rates, perhaps favoring plant species that are well-defended or fix nitrogen. The predicted increase in the number of herbivores is primarily due to relaxed pressure from predators and parasitoids. Elevated temperatures may increase herbivore developmental times, affording them partial escape from discovery by natural enemies, and drought appears to decimate parasitoid populations. The expected decline in parasitoid numbers may be due to direct effects of dry season drought or to the relative scarcity of herbivores during that period. As a consequence, the relative abundance of species will change, and overall biodiversity should decline.

What evidence exists for changes in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts resulting from exposure to alien invasive species in Europe? A systematic map protocol	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE				Review								Background: Invasive alien species are of global concern due to their impacts on biodiversity, related ecosystem services and on economy. A number of invasive alien species are also responsible for human health impacts, either as carriers (vectors) of pathogens, as causal agents of toxic or allergic reactions (e.g. to pollen or insect stings) or injuries. However, there has been relatively little attention given to these human health effects in invasion ecology literature, with no attempts to systematically identify and quantify evidence of impacts. It is likely that further invasive alien species will benefit from global change as some invasive traits provide high plasticity and therefore support adaptation capacities to cope with changing conditions. Thus, global change may lead to new public health concerns as invasive alien species expand their range or enter new areas, or may alter the severity of health impacts by changing the physiology or quantity of potential allergens or irritants produced. This mapping review aims at identifying any evidence for changes in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts resulting from exposure to invasive alien species in Europe over the last 25 years. Methods/Design: A systematic search of both ecological and medical literature will be used to identify potentially relevant studies using three a priori inclusion criteria, i.e. (i) affected human population in Europe, (ii) exposure to alien species, (iii) change in health impact. Studies will be assessed against inclusion criteria at title, abstract and full text to determine relevance to the mapping review. Studies deemed relevant will be coded using predetermined categories relating to the review inclusion criteria and study design, and recorded in a searchable database. Depending on the information available, studies may also be geo-referenced to create a geographic map of the evidence. Descriptive statistics will be used to explore key trends in the evidence base. The searchable database of studies and their main characteristics will be made available with the final report. It is intended that this systematic map will be useful in informing decision making related to the future human health impacts of invasive alien species in Europe.

J	Pichon, NA; Cappelli, SL; Allan, E				Pichon, Noemie A.; Cappelli, Seraina L.; Allan, Eric			Intraspecific trait changes have large impacts on community functional composition but do not affect ecosystem function	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				Article								Plant functional traits can provide a mechanistic understanding of community responses to global change and of community effects on ecosystem functions. Nitrogen enrichment typically shifts trait composition by promoting the dominance of acquisitive plants (high specific leaf area [SLA] and low leaf dry matter content [LDMC]), translating into high biomass production. Changes in mean trait values can be due to shifts in species identity, relative abundances and/or intraspecific trait values. However, we do not know the relative importance of these shifts in determining trait responses to environmental changes, or trait effects on ecosystem functioning, such as biomass production. We quantified the relative importance of species composition, abundance and intraspecific shifts in driving variation in SLA and LDMC, and how these shifts affected above- and below-ground biomass. We measured traits in a grassland experiment manipulating nitrogen fertilisation, plant species richness, foliar fungal pathogen removal and sown functional composition (slow vs. fast species). We fitted structural equation models to test the importance of abundance and intraspecific shifts in determining (a) responses of functional composition to treatments and (b) effects on above- and below-ground biomass. We found that species intraspecific shifts were as important as abundance shifts in determining the overall change in functional composition (community weighted mean trait values), and even had large effects compared to substantial initial variation in sown trait composition. Intraspecific trait shifts resulted in convergence towards intermediate SLA in diverse communities; although convergence was reduced by nitrogen addition and enhanced by pathogen removal. In contrast, large intraspecific shifts in LDMC were not influenced by the treatments. However, despite large responses, intraspecific trait shifts had no effect on above- or below-ground biomass. Only interspecific trait variation affected functioning: below-ground biomass was reduced by SLA and increased by LDMC, while above-ground biomass was increased by SLA. Synthesis. Our results add to a growing body of literature showing large intraspecific trait variation and emphasise the importance of using field collected data to determine community functional composition. However, they also show that intraspecific variation does not necessarily affect ecosystem functioning and therefore response-effect trait relationships may differ between versus within species.

Beech bark necrosis: partitioning the environmental and spatial variation of the damage severity in Central and South-Eastern Europe	ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH				Article								The beech bark necrosis (BBN) infestation severity of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) was assessed in regions of Central (CE) and South-Eastern Europe (SE). Altogether more than 10,000 trees were sampled at 114 sites. Using variation partitioning method, we examined the pure and shared effects of stand, site, climate and spatial sets of variables on mean BBN severity. Our rating included (i) the whole stand, (ii) tree social status classes, (iii) canopy (C) and (iv) understory (U) trees separately. We found that C trees were less affected by BBN than sub-canopy and U trees in both regions. There were found inter-regional differences in amount of explained variability (25.4-73.9%) for whole stand BBN and in the sensitivity of C and U trees to the environmental gradients. The analysis revealed that the climate and spatial variables followed by stand variables had the largest marginal effects on mean BBN severity in all models, while the site set of variables had the weakest one. More than half of the explained variation was shared among four sets of variables in SE, contrary to CE. Except to U trees in SE, the effect of climate - pure or spatially structured - remained the highest also after partitioning of variance; more in SE than in CE. Taking into account positive association between mean annual temperature and mean BBN severity in C trees in SE, reinforced negative effect of climate change on the necrosis might be expected to be more serious mainly in low situated beech forests there. Promoting the tree species diversity in areas with higher incidence of beech bark necrosis, i.e. in low altitudes in SE, could reduce the susceptibility of forests to the necrosis at regional level in the future. For better understanding of the relative importance of environmental and spatial variables on BBN severity, further research performed on finer spatial scale (extent and grain) is necessary, along with accounting for pathogens involved in the infestation.

In wetlands bacterial pathogens are actively preyed on by many protozoa and filter-feeding organisms but this predation can be compensated by the nourishment and protection offered by certain microinvertebrates, acting as hosts, e.g., chitinous rotifers, copepods and cladocerans. The complex interactions of ecological, biological, and genetic components mediate disease-causing organisms to exploit microinvertebrate hosts to occupy diverse niches, obtain nutrition, and withstand physico-chemical stresses. The persistence of the human pathogens in wetlands is often enabled by their association with microinvertebrates and also depends on their quorum sensing mediated colonization, biofilm formation, switching into dormant stage, and horizontal transfer of adaptive genes. The symbiosis with microinvertebrates is facilitated by the pathogen's immune evasion and fitness factors, e.g., Type-IV pili, capsular-polysaccharides, nutrient transportation, virulence and binding proteins, proteases, chitinases, and secretion systems. Spatio-temporal variation in the population of copepods and aquatic eggs/larvae of mosquitoes and midge flies, which act as vectors, can influence the outbreaks of cholera, diarrhea, malaria, dengue, filariasis and drucunculiasis. Changes in climatic factors (temperature, salinity, cyclones, rainfall, etc.) and anthropogenic pollutions (sewage, fertilizer and insecticide) may modify the abundance and biodiversity of microinvertebrates, and thus possibly exacerbate the persistence and dispersal of water-borne pathogens. Thus there is a need to adopt ecohydrological and eco-friendly interventions for managing wetlands while conserving them.

The species has persisted for millions of years and faced drastic environmental fluctuations thanks to its phenotypic plasticity. However, the species has recently declined to historically low levels under synergistic human pressures. Sublethal chemical contamination has been shown to alter reproductive capacity, but the impacts and required actions are not fully addressed by conservation plans. This paper proposes a modelling approach to quantify the effects of sublethal contamination by anthropogenic pollutants on the expression of life history traits and related fitness of the critically endangered European eel. Material and Methods: We sampled female silver eels from eight different catchments across Europe previously shown to be representative of the spectrum of environmental variability and contamination. We measured 11 fitness-related life history traits within four main categories: fecundity, adaptability and plasticity, migratory readiness, and spawning potential. We used machine learning in models to explore the phenotypic reaction (expression of these life history traits) according to geographical parameters, parasite burdens (the introduced nematode Anguillicoloides crassus) and anthropogenic contaminants (persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in muscular tissue and trace elements (TEs) in gonads, livers and muscles). Finally, we simulated, the effects of two management scenarios-contamination reduction and contamination increase-on the fecundity and recruitment. Results: Contamination in our sampling was shown to have a stronger control on life history traits than do geographic and environmental factors that are currently described in the literature. We modelled different contamination scenarios to assess the benefit of mitigation: these scenarios suggest that reducing pollutants concentrations to the lowest values that occurred in our sampling design would double the fecundity of eels compared to the current situation. Discussion: Remediation of contamination could represent a viable management option for increasing the resilience of eel populations, with much more effects than solely reducing fishing mortality. More broadly, our work provides an innovative way for quantitative assessment of the reaction norms of species' biological traits and related fecundity to contamination by organic and inorganic pollutions thus opening new management and conservation pathways to revert the erosion of biodiversity.

The management of plants and their impact on monuments in historic gardens: Current threats and solutions	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING				Review								The conservation of historic gardens is crucial for safeguarding monumental, aesthetic, historical, ecological and economic values in many countries of the World, as well as associated services, such as carbon stock, micro -climate and water regulation, biodiversity conservation, pollution removal, and recreation. In historic gardens, architectural and sculpture elements coexist with an abundant plant component, which is currently often pre-carious due to senescence processes occurring nowadays. Unhealthy plants and reduced structural stability of trees represent a threat for both garden artistic structures and buildings, as well for the visitors' safety. Awareness in garden managers about the most relevant and current threats is necessary for garden conservation. This review, through a global survey of the literature since 1990, addresses two main questions (1) which are the most relevant threats on historic gardens vegetation as affected by environmental, biological and anthropogenic causes, and how do they impact on monuments? (2) Which are related strategies to counteract these threats? Regarding the whole analysed period, the impact of the biotic component on monuments was the most discussed threat; in recent years a growing concern on the effects of climate change and pathogens and pests on historic garden plants also emerged. Strategies to address current and future challenges of historic gardens are hereby identified from experiences reported in worldwide literature and discussed. Best practices are collected in tables to provide managers of historic gardens with a valuable tool and guide to conserve and enhance their value. Due to the heterogeneity of the threats to be addressed, a multidisciplinary approach to ensure the conservation of historic gardens is recommended.

At present, the G. morsitans are mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa. But modifications of its distribution undergoing as a result of climate change is still unknown. In order to provide scientific basis for effective monitoring and G. morsitans control, this study aimed to collect the distribution and to explore the potentially suitable habitat for G. morsitans under various scenarios. We downloaded the major data of G. morsitans occurrence from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Maxent software and R language were employed to analyze the relationship between occurrence records and climatic variables and project the potentially suitable habitat for G. morsitans in historical and future periods. The results showed that Isothermality contributed most to the distribution of G. morsitans. The predicted potentially suitable areas for G. morsitans under historical climate conditions include a large area of Africa near and below the equator, small equatorial regions of southern Asia, America, and Oceania. Under the future climate conditions, the potentially suitable areas would decline about -5.38 +/- 1.00% as a whole under all SSPs compared with 1970-2000. Glossina morsitans is a vector for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), which is mainly distributed in sub-Saharan Africa at present. Our objective was to project the historical and future potentially suitable areas globally and explore the influence of climatic factors. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) was utilized to evaluate the contribution rates of bio-climatic factors and to project suitable habitats for G. morsitans. We found that Isothermality and Precipitation of Wettest Quarter contributed most to the distribution of G. morsitans. The predicted potentially suitable areas for G. morsitans under historical climate conditions would be 14.5 million km(2), including a large area of Africa which is near and below the equator, small equatorial regions of southern Asia, America, and Oceania. Under future climate conditions, the potentially suitable areas are expected to decline by about -5.38 +/- 1.00% overall, under all shared socioeconomic pathways, compared with 1970-2000. The potentially suitable habitats of G. morsitans may not be limited to Africa. Necessary surveillance and preventive measures should be taken in high-risk regions.

There is growing evidence of declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel declines in plants relying upon them. The STEP project (Status and Trends of European Pollinators, 2010-2015, www.step-project.net) is documenting critical elements in the nature and extent of these declines, examining key functional traits associated with pollination deficits, and developing a Red List for some European pollinator groups. Together these activities are laying the groundwork for future pollinator monitoring programmes. STEP is also assessing the relative importance of potential drivers of pollinator declines, including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, light pollution, and their interactions. We are measuring the ecological and economic impacts of declining pollinator services and floral resources, including effects on wild plant populations, crop production and human nutrition. STEP is reviewing existing and potential mitigation options, and providing novel tests of their effectiveness across Europe. Our work is building upon existing and newly developed datasets and models, complemented by spatially-replicated campaigns of field research to fill gaps in current knowledge. Findings are being integrated into a policy-relevant framework to create evidence-based decision support tools. STEP is establishing communication links to a wide range of stakeholders across Europe and beyond, including policy makers, beekeepers, farmers, academics and the general public. Taken together, the STEP research programme aims to improve our understanding of the nature, causes, consequences and potential mitigation of declines in pollination services at local, national, continental and global scales.

Comparing Adaptive Capacity in Simplifying and Diversifying Farming Systems	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS				Review								Humanity faces a triple threat of climate change, biodiversity loss, and global food insecurity. In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production toward centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges-foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure-we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of broad and nimble adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances. Our cases suggest that, in order to garner the most adaptive benefits from diversification, farming systems should balance the pursuit of multiple goals, which in turn requires an inclusive process for active dialogue and negotiation among diverse perspectives. Instead of locking farming systems into pernicious cycles that reproduce social and ecological externalities, diversification processes can enable nimble responses to a broad spectrum of possible stressors and shocks, while also promoting social equity and ecological sustainability.

Species and functional diversity of macrofungi from protected areas in mountain forest ecosystems of Southern Luzon, Philippines	TROPICAL ECOLOGY				Article								Fungi and their functions are among the least studied component of the ecosystem such that not more than 10% were named based on global conservative species estimate. In the Philippines, the species described do not reflect on documentation and conservation efforts amidst threat of forest degradation and climate change. This study investigated the current macrofungal diversity in parts of three important protected mountain forest ecosystems in Southern Tagalog Region in the Philippines: Mount Makiling Forest Reserve (MMFR), Mount Banahaw-San Cristobal Protected Landscape (MBSCPL), and Quezon Protected Landscape (QPL). Macrofungal sporocarps were collected and documented from selected sites and preserved as voucher specimens. Samples were characterized using morphological, anatomical, and chemical properties then validated field identification from mycological herbarium and consulted experts. Sixteen species representing 11 families with Shannon diversity index of 2.79 were observed from MMFR. Collections from MBSCPL were 35 species under 19 families with Shannon diversity index of 3.14. QPL recorded 21 species from 12 families with Shannon diversity index of 3.04. The diversity of macrofungi from protected areas showed unique species composition based on non-metric multidimensional scaling with high dissimilarity based on Bray-Curtis Index, suggesting possible differences in carbon sink on forest floor. Functional diversity of recorded taxa described a balanced proportion of saprophytic and mycorrhizal fungi with few parasitic fungi having economic and cultural values. Variations in macrofungal species and functions could reflect on the status of protected areas in terms of productivity and sustainability, requiring extensive sampling and monitoring to cover macrofungi in biodiversity assessment and conservation programs in this region of the country.

Keith, DA		Biogeography of Australia's Dry Sclerophyll Forests: Drought, Nutrients and Fire	AUSTRALIAN VEGETATION, 3RD EDITION				Article; Book Chapter								Australia's dry sclerophyll forests are fire-prone ecosystems characterised by a diverse and spectacular sclerophyll flora and occurring on infertile soils. In the east, they are distributed in an arc from south-east Queensland to the Adelaide region and in the eastern half of Tasmania. In the west, they are restricted to the south-west corner on the Darling scarp and Swan coastal plain. The distribution of dry sclerophyll forests has historically been interpreted as reflecting patterns of seasonal drought, but this theory has long been discarded in favour of one of edaphic control (nutrient-poverty). Both theories exemplify classical resource-based models of evolutionary or ecological convergence. Neither, however, can adequately account for patterns in the structure, floristics and dynamics of fire-prone ecosystems. In this chapter, we examine the influence of climate and geology on the distribution of dry sclerophyll forest in terms of both resource constraints and as drivers of fire-regimes. Climate, through its control of primary productivity and fire weather, and soils, which influence flammability via the expression of sclerophylly, underpin biogeographical patterns in the frequency, intensity and seasonality of fires, and thus, potentially, the distribution of dry sclerophyll forests. Fire is a primary focus of management and necessitates finding a delicate balance between fuel reduction and biodiversity conservation. Dry sclerophyll forests are relatively resilient to invasion by alien plant species but many species are susceptible to fungal pathogens such as Phytophthora cinnamomi. The most serious threats to dry sclerophyll forests in the future include spread of disease and changes in rainfall patterns and fire regimes associated with anthropogenic climate change.

This issue has implications for the epidemiology of sand fly-borne diseases, especially sand fly-associated viruses. Few studies concerning sand fly-associated viruses have been conducted in Thailand. Therefore, this study aimed to perform a molecular survey of groups of pathogenic RNA viruses belonging to the Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae in sand fly samples collected from southern Thailand. Methods: Sand flies were collected at two locations in Trang and Songkhla provinces of southern Thailand, and individual sand fly samples were processed for species identification and virus detection. The Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera and family Rhabdoviridae molecular determination was performed by RT-PCR, and positive samples were identified by cloning and sequencing, cell culture inoculation, and phylogenetic analysis. Results: The results presented in this study were based on the analysis of a total of 331 female sand flies. This molecular study revealed evidence of Rhabdoviridae family virus presence in Phlebotomus papatasi (3/331, 0.9%). The findings demonstrated a new cluster of rhabdovirus that was closely related to Bactrocera dorsalis sigmavirus strain BDSV.abc5 and the lineages of insect-specific Rhabdoviridae. In addition, the Bayesian tree suggested that the common ancestor of this group was the dimarhabdovirus clade. It was assumed that the virus may have switched hosts during its evolution. However, the detection of Orbivirus, Phlebovirus, and Flavivirus genera using specific primers for RT-PCR was negative in the collected sand flies. Conclusions: There is limited knowledge on the genetic diversity and ecology of Rhabdoviridae in Thailand. This is the first data regarding the circulation of Rhabdoviridae in Ph. papatasi from Thailand. We found a new cluster of rhabdoviruses that was close to the new B. dorsalis sigmavirus. It is possible that there is a great deal of diversity in this family yet to be discovered, and a more extensive survey for new rhabdoviruses may uncover viruses from a wide diversity of host taxa and broaden our understanding of the relationships among the Rhabdoviridae.

Risk of predation enhances the lethal effects of UV-B in amphibians	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				Article								Amphibian declines are a prominent part of the global biodiversity crisis and have received special consideration because they have occurred relatively recently, on a global scale, and in seemingly pristine habitats where no obvious anthropogenic cause is apparent. Although several causes for declines have been implicated, the isolation of a singular cause has proven elusive. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that complex interactions between multiple environmental stressors, particularly those associated with global change, may be responsible. Increasing ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) associated with stratospheric ozone depletion is one such stressor that has received considerable attention. UV-B causes enhanced lethal effects when combined with other factors such as aquatic pH, contaminants, temperature and pathogens, but little is known of how UV-B interacts with pervasive biological stressors, such as risk of predation. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to UV-B and predatory chemical cues in a controlled laboratory experiment to determine their independent and interactive effects on survival and morphology. We show that UV-B and risk of predation interact synergistically to enhance mortality above the additive effects of the independent stressors, and that exposure to UV-B affects the ability of tadpoles to morphologically respond to predatory chemical cues (i.e. predator-induced phenotypic plasticity), which has implications for their survival in an environment with predators. This highlights the importance of considering both anthropogenic and naturally occurring stressors when examining the underlying causes of amphibian declines.

J	Syal, S				Syal, Shruti			Learning from pandemics: Applying resilience thinking to identify priorities for planning urban settlements	JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT				Article								Based in an interdisciplinary review of the literature on COVID-19 and recent outbreaks, this paper uses pandemics as a lens to examine the socio-ecological resilience of human settlements. This narrative literature review applies the conceptual framework for resilience developed for complex systems to identify five planning and policy issues critical to disease emergence, transmission, and outbreak. First, since urban settlements and activities facilitate pathogen transmission between species, reducing 'shocks' like zoonotic diseases and climate change requires not just prioritizing urbanization patterns and land use in urban policies for environmental health, but also animal rearing practices and biodiversity maintenance. Second, since disease transmission is linked to not just contact rate but also host susceptibility, reducing vulnerability by improving equity in access to essential infrastructures like housing, water, sanitation, healthy food, green/public spaces, healthcare-that impact human health directly and indirectly-is critical. In its absence, curbing disease transmission requires focusing on contact rate suppression, but doing so brings human activity to a halt, decimating the economy and livelihoods. Third, the persistence of many pathogens or their vectors in environmental media suggests that built environment & public health professionals must address maintenance of environmental quality at various scales. Fourth, there is a need for redundancy, be it in commodity supply chains (like PPE, food) or data management for say, monitoring & enforcement of home quarantines during a pandemic. Fifth, while it is crucial to have a centralized response for healthcare, decentralized infrastructure management has been critical during this outbreak: including participatory governance structures to recruit civil society in data collection and self-reporting, reliance on and quick development of mutual aid groups to distribute food and other essential supplies, localized approaches to repurposing infrastructures to create safe public spaces. This application of resilience thinking also evokes the need to study cities as social-ecological systems.

J	Mbinda, W; Masaki, H				Mbinda, Wilton; Masaki, Hosea			Breeding Strategies and Challenges in the Improvement of Blast Disease Resistance in Finger Millet. A Current Review	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				Review								Climate change has significantly altered the biodiversity of crop pests and pathogens, posing a major challenge to sustainable crop production. At the same time, with the increasing global population, there is growing pressure on plant breeders to secure the projected food demand by improving the prevailing yield of major food crops. Finger millet is an important cereal crop in southern Asia and eastern Africa, with excellent nutraceutical properties, long storage period, and a unique ability to grow under arid and semi-arid environmental conditions. Finger millet blast disease caused by the filamentous ascomycetous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating disease affecting the growth and yield of this crop in all its growing regions. The frequent breakdown of blast resistance because of the susceptibility to rapidly evolving virulent genes of the pathogen causes yield instability in all finger millet-growing areas. The deployment of novel and efficient strategies that provide dynamic and durable resistance against many biotypes of the pathogen and across a wide range of agro-ecological zones guarantees future sustainable production of finger millet. Here, we analyze the breeding strategies currently being used for improving resistance to disease and discuss potential future directions toward the development of new blast-resistant finger millet varieties, providing a comprehensive understanding of promising concepts for finger millet breeding. The review also includes empirical examples of how advanced molecular tools have been used in breeding durably blast-resistant cultivars. The techniques highlighted are cost-effective high-throughput methods that strongly reduce the generation cycle and accelerate both breeding and research programs, providing an alternative to conventional breeding methods for rapid introgression of disease resistance genes into favorable, susceptible cultivars. New information and knowledge gathered here will undoubtedly offer new insights into sustainable finger millet disease control and efficient optimization of the crop's productivity.

Extreme drought, host density, sex, and bullfrogs influence fungal pathogen infection in a declining lotic amphibian	ECOSPHERE				Article								Freshwater biodiversity is imperiled across the globe, and multiple stressors such as habitat alteration, non-native species invasion, disease, and climate change can act in concert to threaten vulnerable taxa. The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, is one of the causative factors of severe amphibian declines. The foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) is a stream-breeding anuran endemic to California and Oregon (USA) that has declined precipitously in recent decades, yet there is little information on its susceptibility to Bd. In the fall of 2013, we observed dead and dying juvenile R. boylii in a San Francisco Bay Area watershed where annual amphibian breeding censuses have been conducted since 1997 in a free-flowing reach and since 2003 in an anthropogenically modified stream reach. High pathogen loads on R. boylii and histologic lesions observed on a dead R. boylii metamorph collected from the site were consistent with lethal chytridiomycosis. The outbreak coincided with extremely low stream flows in autumn that concentrated frogs in drying pools and the absence of high peak flows in winter that allowed non-native American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) to expand their spatial distribution in the stream network. Following the outbreak, we surveyed R. boylii and sympatric anurans at the site for the next two years to determine Bd trends within the population. Using mixed-effects models, we found that bullfrog presence was a positive predictor of both Bd prevalence and Bd load in R. boylii. Prevalence was also influenced by sex and life stage: Adult males were more likely to be infected than either females or juveniles. Moreover, we found that stream flow volume was negatively associated with Bd load. These results indicate that disease, drought, and flow regulation may interact synergistically to impact amphibians in ways not previously recognized, informing stream flow management strategies for native aquatic taxa.

Effects of management on ambrosia beetles and their antagonists in European beech forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				Article								Land-use intensification has been shown to negatively affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Because higher trophic levels are expected to suffer most strongly from intensification, negative consequences for ecosystem services, such as biological pest control by natural enemies, are likely. In European beech forests ambrosia beetles are common secondary pests of freshly cut wood and stored timber, but they may also infest living trees that are highly stressed. We examined whether forest management intensity, ranging from unmanaged beech forests to non-natural conifer plantations, affects the abundance, attack rate, and breeding success of ambrosia beetles across three regions of Germany. We applied pheromone trapping to estimate the abundance of ambrosia beetles and exposed experimental beech logs to measure infestation rates and breeding success. In general, we found decreasing abundance and attack probability by ambrosia beetles with increasing management intensity, which is most likely related to the availability of suitable breeding substrate. However, the abundance of the invasive species Xylosandrus germanus increased with increasing management intensity in one region, where high management intensity was represented by pine forests; the drier and warmer conditions in this forest type most likely increased population densities. Breeding success of Trypodendron domesticum increased with increasing management intensity, suggesting less effective pest control by natural antagonists, in particular by specialised parasitoids, at high management intensities. We conclude that the availability of breeding substrate, in combination with microclimate and antagonist effectiveness, shape ambrosia beetle populations in Central European forests. Forest management strategies should thus reduce the availability of breeding substrate in production forests, in particular where microclimatic conditions are favourable for beetle reproduction (i.e. warm, moist). Moreover, unmanaged forest patches should be maintained to promote parasitoid abundance and thus to mitigate negative effects of climate change, such as increasing drought stress of trees.

J	O'Toole, B; Simmons, NB; Hekkala, E				O'Toole, Brian; Simmons, Nancy B.; Hekkala, Evon			Reconstructing the genomic diversity of a widespread Sub-Saharan bat (Pteropodidae: Eidolon helvum) using archival museum collections	ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA				Article								Modern phylogeographic methods have confirmed that species with broad ranges often exhibit fine-scale patterns of genetic variation that are not reflected in their morphology. Recent genetic analyses of the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) deviate from this trend in identifying this species as broadly panmictic across its range in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the limitations of sampling, along with potential for modern anthropogenic impacts to distort observed patterns, suggest that additional work is needed to assess true historical patterns of geographic variation in this species. We used Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods to assess patterns of variation found in historical samples of E. helvum and its sister species, E. dupreanum (a Malagasy endemic). Patterns of genomic variation observed among specimens collected between 1909 and 1983 were compared with those from more recently collected tissue samples from across much of the range of the genus. Our genetic analyses confirm that E. helvum and E. dupreanum are distinct species as traditionally recognized. Congruent with results from prior analyses of modern samples, no patterns of spatial genomic structuring were identified in E. helvum across continental Africa in either recent times or earlier in the 20th century. These results suggest that the currently observed pattern of panmixia in E. helvum is not a recent phenomenon; significant gene flow is apparently ongoing in this species across an exceptionally large area. This suggests that potentially zoonotic pathogens previously associated with populations of E. helvum may be similarly distributed or episodically transmitted across broad areas by this species. Our study additionally demonstrates that analyses utilizing 'archival' DNA from older specimens in museum collections have the potential to illuminate patterns of both past and contemporary biodiversity, and to help assess the impacts of habitat loss and climate change on species at the genomic level.

J	Freer-Smith, PH; Webber, JF				Freer-Smith, Peter H.; Webber, Joan F.			Tree pests and diseases: the threat to biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				Article								The increasing number of invasive pests and pathogens entering North America and Europe indicate that the threat which they pose to forests is increasing concurrently with climate change and globalisation. To date research has mainly focussed on the protection of trees of economic importance. In most countries the major portion of research costs tend to be borne by the state with governments funding tree health research and the implementation of statutory work (risk assessment, border inspection and surveillance), whilst commercial enterprises cover the costs of ongoing management of established pests and pathogens. The costs of responding to new outbreaks tend to be shared with government or regional authorities organising initial response but owners covering subsequent operational costs without state compensation. However in recent years a number of major epidemics have devastated natural ecosystems and landscapes valued both for timber and for their wider benefits to the general public. Against this background it is helpful to consider more explicitly the consequences of pests and pathogens for the full range of ecosystem services. Biodiversity was originally perceived to be an ecosystem service but is now recognised as fundamental in supporting ecological function. Many ecosystem services are uncosted and enjoyed by a range of stakeholders raising important questions about who is responsible for measures to protect tree health. We present data here on the new outbreaks which have occurred in the UK and, as an example of rapid spread of a disease, on the development of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus in the UK over the last 3 years. These data indicate that tree pests and diseases represent a major contemporary problem to which the ecosystem services concept, and its associated implications for cost sharing, can move forward our approach to prevention and outbreak management and may improve the outcomes of international measures to minimise the man-mediated movement and impacts of pests and pathogens.

Here we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of insect pests and pathogens targeting natural and planted forests in Africa, and raise awareness of this growing emergency. Data availability and limited biosecurity of some countries are limiting the ability to tackle this invasion. An improved knowledge of taxonomy, distribution, and damage caused by these organisms will be crucial for developing continent-wide strategies to manage this emergency and enhance country-level intervention capacity. Summary An increasing multitude of insect pests and pathogens is targeting indigenous trees of natural forests, agroforestry systems, and exotic trees in planted forests in Africa. This is raising major concerns for a continent already challenged by adaptations to climate change, as it threatens a vital resource for food security of rural communities, economic growth, and ecosystem conservation. The accidental introduction through trade of non-native species in particular is accelerating, and it adds to the damage to tree-based landscapes by native pests and diseases. Old-time and new invaders heavily impact planted forests of exotic eucalypts, pines, and acacias, and are spreading quickly across African regions. But many non-native pathogens are recently found affecting important indigenous trees. We describe the threat to African trees by providing an overview of highly relevant insect pests and diseases of indigenous and exotic trees in Africa, and discuss implications for management and future research. The implementation of an integrated and globally coordinated approach based on improved biosecurity, biological control, and tree resistance would contribute to mitigate the potentially devastating impact of these invasions on African natural resources.

J	Lange, L				Lange, Lene			The importance of fungi and mycology for addressing major global challenges	IMA FUNGUS				Article								In the new bioeconomy, fungi play a very important role in addressing major global challenges, being instrumental for improved resource efficiency, making renewable substitutes for products from fossil resources, upgrading waste streams to valuable food and feed ingredients, counteracting life-style diseases and antibiotic resistance through strengthening the gut biota, making crop plants more robust to survive climate change conditions, and functioning as host organisms for production of new biological drugs. This range of new uses of fungi all stand on the shoulders of the efforts of mycologists over generations: the scientific discipline mycology has built comprehensive understanding within fungal biodiversity, classification, evolution, genetics, physiology, ecology, pathogenesis, and nutrition. Applied mycology could not make progress without this platform. To unfold the full potentials of what fungi can do for both environment and man we need to strengthen the field of mycology on a global scale. The current mission statement gives an overview of where we are, what needs to be done, what obstacles to overcome, and which potentials are within reach. It further provides a vision for how mycology can be strengthened: The time is right to make the world aware of the immense importance of fungi and mycology for sustainable global development, where land, water and biological materials are used in a more efficient and more sustainable manner. This is an opportunity for profiling mycology by narrating the role played by fungi in the bioeconomy. Greater awareness and appreciation of the role of fungi can be used to build support for mycology around the world. Support will attract more talent to our field of study, empower mycologists around the world to generate more funds for necessary basic research, and strengthen the global mycology network. The use of fungi for unlocking the full potentials of the bioeconomy relies on such progress. The fungal kingdom can be an inspiration for even more.

Currently, this pathogen is considered the main limiting factor for cocoa production in the country. In this study, the ecological niche of the cultivation of T. cacao and M. roreri was evaluated to identify the possible changes in the potential geographic distributions and in the areas of crop-pathogen coexistence in the face of climate change scenarios. For this, records of the presence of M. roreri and T. cacao were collected from national and international databases. Fifteen bioclimatic variables of worldclim 1.4 for the present and future were selected, and the algorithm of maximum entropy MaxEnt to obtain the models. The areas where cocoa and the phytopathogen are potentially distributed are the coastal and Amazon regions of the country at present. The transfer of models in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the year 2050, predicted the expansion of areas suitable for cocoa, especially in the south of the country, by 16% and 18%, respectively. On the contrary, for the phytopathogen, the model predicts a 5% decrease in suitability in the same future scenarios in the Ecuadorian Amazon region. The areas susceptible to the invasion of the fungus and coexistence with cocoa coincide and are located mainly in the Ecuadorian coast and Amazon for the present and future scenarios, representing a risk for cocoa cultivation. For this reason, it is suggested to adopt early warning measures for the detection and control of the disease, focused on these risk areas for the conservation of biodiversity and food security in the country.

J	Cunze, S; Klimpel, S				Cunze, Sarah; Klimpel, Sven			From the Balkan towards Western Europe: Range expansion of the golden jackal (Canis aureus)-A climatic niche modeling approach	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				Article								In recent decades, a rapid range expansion of the golden jackal (Canis aureus) towards Northern and Western Europe has been observed. The golden jackal is a medium-sized canid, with a broad and flexible diet. Almost 200 different parasite species have been reported worldwide from C. aureus, including many parasites that are shared with dogs and cats and parasite species of public health concern. As parasites may follow the range shifts of their host, the range expansion of the golden jackal could be accompanied by changes in the parasite fauna in the new ecosystems. In the new distribution area, the golden jackal could affect ecosystem equilibrium, e.g., through changed competition situations or predation pressure. In a niche modeling approach, we project the future climatic habitat suitability of the golden jackal in Europe in the context of whether climatic changes promote range expansion. We use an ensemble forecast based on six presence-absence algorithms to estimate the climatic suitability of C. aureus for different time periods up to the year 2100 considering different IPCC scenarios on future development. As predictor variables, we used six bioclimatic variables provided by worldclim. Our results clearly indicate that areas with climatic conditions analogous to those of the current core distribution area of the golden jackal in Europe will strongly expand towards the north and the west in future decades. Thus, the observed range expansion may be favored by climate change. The occurrence of stable populations can be expected in Central Europe. With regard to biodiversity and public health concerns, the population and range dynamics of the golden jackal should be surveyed. Correlative niche models provide a useful and frequently applied tool for this purpose. The results can help to make monitoring more efficient by identifying areas with suitable habitat and thus a higher probability of occurrence.

People, pollution and pathogens - Global change impacts in mountain freshwater ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				Review								Mountain catchments provide for the livelihood of more than half of humankind, and have become a key destination for tourist and recreation activities globally. Mountain ecosystems are generally considered to be less complex and less species diverse due to the harsh environmental conditions. As such, they are also more sensitive to the various impacts of the Anthropocene. For this reason, mountain regions may serve as sentinels of change and provide ideal ecosystems for studying climate and global change impacts on biodiversity. We here review different facets of anthropogenic impacts on mountain freshwater ecosystems. We put particular focus on micropollutants and their distribution and redistribution due to hydrological extremes, their direct influence on water quality and their indirect influence on ecosystem health via changes of freshwater species and their interactions. We show that those changes may drive pathogen establishment in new environments with harmful consequences for freshwater species, but also for the human population. Based on the reviewed literature, we recommend reconstructing the recent past of anthropogenic impact through sediment analyses, to focus efforts on small, but highly productive waterbodies, and to collect data on the occurrence and variability of microorganisms, biofilms, plankton species and key species, such as amphibians due to their bioindicator value for ecosystem health and water quality. The newly gained knowledge can then be used to develop a comprehensive framework of indicators to robustly inform policy and decision making on current and future risks for ecosystem health and human well-being.

Nutrition and its role in human evolution	JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE				Review								Our understanding of human evolution has improved rapidly over recent decades, facilitated by large-scale cataloguing of genomic variability amongst both modern and archaic humans. It seems clear that the evolution of the ancestors of chimpanzees and hominins separated 7-9million years ago with some migration out of Africa by the earlier hominins; Homo sapiens slowly emerged as climate change resulted in drier, less forested African conditions. The African populations expanded and evolved in many different conditions with slow mutation and selection rates in the human genome, but with much more rapid mutation occurring in mitochondrial DNA. We now have evidence stretching back 300000years of humans in their current form, but there are clearly four very different large African language groups that correlate with population DNA differences. Then, about 50000-100000years ago a small subset of modern humans also migrated out of Africa resulting in a persistent signature of more limited genetic diversity amongst non-African populations. Hybridization with archaic hominins occurred around this time such that all non-African modern humans possess some Neanderthal ancestry and Melanesian populations additionally possess some Denisovan ancestry. Human populations both within and outside Africa also adapted to diverse aspects of their local environment including altitude, climate, UV exposure, diet and pathogens, in some cases leaving clear signatures of patterns of genetic variation. Notable examples include haemoglobin changes conferring resistance to malaria, other immune changes and the skin adaptations favouring the synthesis of vitamin D. As humans migrated across Eurasia, further major mitochondrial changes occurred with some interbreeding with ancient hominins and the development of alcohol intolerance. More recently, an ability to retain lactase persistence into adulthood has evolved rapidly under the environmental stimulus of pastoralism with the ability to husband lactating ruminants. Increased amylase copy numbers seem to relate to the availability of starchy foods, whereas the capacity to desaturase and elongate monounsaturated fatty acids in different societies seems to be influenced by whether there is a lack of supply of readily available dietary sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The process of human evolution includes genetic drift and adaptation to local environments, in part through changes in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. These genetic changes may underlie susceptibilities to some modern human pathologies including folate-responsive neural tube defects, diabetes, other age-related pathologies and mental health disorders.

Loss of protozoan and metazoan intestinal symbiont biodiversity in wild primates living in unprotected forests	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				Article								In light of the current biodiversity crisis, investigating the human impact on non-human primate gut biology is important to understanding the ecological significance of gut community dynamics across changing habitats and its role in conservation. Using traditional coproscopic parasitological techniques, we compared the gastrointestinal protozoan and metazoan symbiont richness of two primates: the Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) and the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus). These species live sympatrically in both protected and unprotected forests within the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania with distinct ecological adaptations and diets. Our results showed that terrestrial and omnivorous yellow baboons had 2 (95% CI 1.47-2.73) and 3.78 (2.62-5.46) times higher gut symbiont richness (both including and excluding rare protozoans) compared to the arboreal and leaf-eating Udzungwa red colobus in unprotected and protected forest, respectively. We also found a consistent depletion of symbiont richness in red colobus living in the unprotected forest fragment compared to the continuous protected forests [the latter having 1.97 times (95% CI 1.33-2.92) higher richness], but not in yellow baboons. Richness reduction was particularly evident in the Udzungwa red colobus monkeys, confirming the pattern we reported previously for gut bacterial communities. This study demonstrates the impact of human activities even on the microbiodiversity of the intestinal tract of this species. Against the background of rapid global change and habitat degradation, and given the health benefits of intact gut communities, the decrease in natural gut symbionts reported here is worrying. Further study of these communities should form an essential part of the conservation framework.

Extreme Events Trigger Terrestrial and Marine Ecosystem Collapses in the Southwestern USA and Southwestern Australia	ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE AND CLIMATE CHANGE	Ecological Studies-Analysis and Synthesis			Article; Book Chapter								We outline the multiple, cross-scale, and complex consequences of terrestrial and marine ecosystem heatwaves in two regions on opposite sides of the planet: the southwestern USA and southwestern Australia, both encompassing Global Biodiversity Hotspots, and where ecosystem collapses or features of it have occurred in the past two decades. We highlight ecosystem shifts that have clearly demonstrated a substantial change from a baseline state over time, although not necessarily across their entire distribution, with evidence of collapse at local scales. Responses to temperature extremes, such as heatwaves, encompass processes at all scales, including population level (e.g. altered demography such as survival, recruitment, and fecundity, together resulting in structural changes), community level (e.g. species compositional shifts), and ecosystem level (e.g. carbon loss), as well as physical properties altered by vegetation loss (e.g. microclimate, fire behaviour on land). These changes impact all trophic levels with foundational species losses (such as seagrasses, kelp, and trees), flowing through to vertebrates (such as sea turtles, penguins, and cockatoos). Where extensive collapse has occurred, shifts in microclimate could affect important biosphere-to-atmosphere feedbacks including fluxes of energy, carbon, and water. Such extensive changes usually do not occur in isolation and frequently interact with other disturbance processes such as fire, storms, pathogen and pest outbreaks, and anthropogenic stressors. Interactions may alter the likelihood, extent, or severity of subsequent disturbances (linked disturbances) as well as condition the ecological response and recovery (compound disturbances). In addition, if ecosystem collapse is extensive enough (e.g. tree die-off), those changes also can impact climate and ecosystems elsewhere via ecoclimate teleconnections. Increasing rates of climatic extremes will drive a host of direct and indirect feedbacks certain to produce large-scale shifts in ecological functioning at unprecedented rates. Understanding how, why, and where these shifts will occur will be critical for effective ecosystem management and climate change mitigation.

Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

This may negatively affect their fitness and the efficiency of their ecosystem service provision. Dung beetles are ecosystem service providers: through feeding on and burying dung, they facilitate nutrient recycling, secondary seed dispersal, parasite control, soil bioturbation and dung decomposition. As such, prediction of how dung beetles respond to multiple anthropogenic environmental changes is critical for the conservation of ecosystem services. Here, we quantified ecosystem services via dung utilisation and dung ball production in three telecoprid species: Allogymnopleurus indigaceous, Scarabaeus zambezianus and Khepher prodigiosus. We examined ecosystem service efficiency factorially under different beetle densities towards different dung masses and under three temperature treatments (21 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 35 degrees C). Khepher prodigiosus, exhibited greatest dung utilisation efficiency overall across dung masses, compared to both S. zambezianus and A. indigaceous. Dung removal was exhibited under all the tested temperatures by all tested species, and therefore the sub-optimal temperatures employed here did not fully inhibit ecosystem service delivery. However, emergent effects among temperatures, beetle species and beetle density further affected removal efficiency: S. zambezianus and A. indigaceous utilisation increased with both warming and beetle density, whereas K. prodigiosus performance was less temperature-and density-dependent. Beetles also tended to exhibit positive density-dependence as dung supply increased. The numbers of dung balls produced differed across species, and increased with temperature and densities, with S. zambezianus producing significantly most balls overall. Our study provides novel evidence for differential density-dependent ecosystem service delivery among species across stressful temperature regimes and emergent effects for dung mass utilisation. This information is essential for biodiversity-ecosystem-function and is critical for the conservation of functionally efficacious species, with implications for natural capital conservation policy in rapidly changing environments.

B	Engelbrecht, H	Engelbrecht, H			Engelbrecht, Hubert	Engelbrecht, H		Fauna	250 YEARS OF INDUSTRIAL CONSUMPTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF NATURE: Impacts on Global Ecosystems and Life				Article; Book Chapter								Humans have intruded and degraded aquatic and terrestrial biospheres by hunting, overexploitation, land take, habitat dissection and destruction, agriculture, mining, damming, water management, pollution, and import of xenospecies and of pathogens. This caused the trend of anthropogenic defaunation and homogenisation. Littoral faunas are most endangered, because of the interfering impacts from both land and ocean. Fishery-induced evolutionary pressure resulted in smaller sized species. Global fish catch quota declined since 1996. Climate change-induced evolutionary and ecological responses in many equatorial marine species revealed the insufficiency of genetic shifts and adaptations to prevent range contractions and extinctions. But species more poleward have enlarged their ranges. Sea water warming, acidification, and deoxygenation are, except on e.g. cephalopoda, the main stressors. Calcifying species are impaired in the growth of their shells and skeletons. 75% of global coral reefs are threatened. Sea water warming has caused the displacement of native species by intruding thermophilic species and temporal mismatches between life-cycle phases and available food. Sea channel constructions have caused the intrusion of xenospecies. Marine faunas have been impaired by oil spills and bioaccumulating toxins. Homogenisation of land has resulted in habitat loss and biodiversity decline of e.g. avian species. Applied biocides have impaired the fitness of bee species and immune functions of wildlife populations. Immissions of reactive N have caused a decrease in plant diversity and, consequently, of specialised insects. Billions of animal fatalities have occurred annually by roadkill, other collisions, and nocturnal illumination. Warming has caused the average body mass of Alpine chamois and Arctic reindeer to decline. Episodes of zoonotic diseases were caused by industrial large scale livestock farming. Organic contaminants and heavy metals have been observed to accumulate in the food chain. Thawing permafrost has resulted in reactivation of buried pathogens. Soil microbiota have been impaired by acid and toxic immissions. Specialised microfaunas have developed in acid mine drainages and in the deep biosphere impacted by fracking fluids. The importance of biophilia is expressed.

The conservation status of amphibians in the West Indies	CONSERVATION OF CARIBBEAN ISLAND HERPETOFAUNAS, VOL 1: CONSERVATION BIOLOGY AND THE WIDER CARIBBEAN				Article; Book Chapter								There are 196 species of amphibians known from the West Indies, 188 of which are native. With only a few exceptions, all of those native species are endemic to single islands or island banks and most are restricted to a small region within an island such as a single mountain top. The native species are members of the following families: Aromobatidae (1 species), Bufonidae (12 sp.), Hylidae (9 sp.), Eleutherodactylidae (161 sp.), Leptodactylidae (3 sp.), and Strabomantidae (2 sp.). The recent Global Amphibian Assessment found that 84% of West Indian amphibian species are threatened and that 71% are in the two highest threat categories, Endangered and Critically Endangered. The remote areas where many species occur constrain monitoring efforts, but remarkably, 49 species (26% of all native species) have not been observed in at least 10 years and 31 species (16%) in at least 20 years. Much-needed surveys will almost certainly find some of those species, but five species have not been found despite intensive search efforts, and are likely extinct - for unknown reasons. Small distributions and declining habitat area and quality were the most important considerations in determining conservation status. Many species are contained within national parks and other protected areas, but the effectiveness of the protected areas varies from essentially no protection to moderately good protection. Unfortunately, most of the critically endangered species occur in countries (e. g., Haiti) where protected areas have low effectiveness. Deforestation and habitat modification continue to be the most serious and widespread threats, although the impacts of an introduced fungal pathogen and climate change are being carefully monitored. For unexplained reasons, the largest conservation agencies, The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International, have yet to establish programs of any significance in countries of the Caribbean region (e. g., Haiti) where the biodiversity crisis is the most severe. Nearly all of the biological data used in determining the conservation status of species comes from the field of systematics and taxonomy rather than ecology, yet this fact has yet to be fully appreciated by the culture of conservation.

Environmental degradation amplifies species' responses to temperature variation in a trophic interaction	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY				Article								Land-use and climate change are two of the primary drivers of the current biodiversity crisis. However, we lack understanding of how single-species and multispecies associations are affected by interactions between multiple environmental stressors. We address this gap by examining how environmental degradation interacts with daily stochastic temperature variation to affect individual life history and population dynamics in a host-parasitoid trophic interaction, using the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, and its parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. We carried out a single-generation individual life-history experiment and a multigeneration microcosm experiment during which individuals and microcosms were maintained at a mean temperature of 26 degrees C that was either kept constant or varied stochastically, at four levels of host resource degradation, in the presence or absence of parasitoids. At the individual level, resource degradation increased juvenile development time and decreased adult body size in both species. Parasitoids were more sensitive to temperature variation than their hosts, with a shorter juvenile stage duration than in constant temperatures and a longer adult life span in moderately degraded environments. Resource degradation also altered the host's response to temperature variation, leading to a longer juvenile development time at high resource degradation. At the population level, moderate resource degradation amplified the effects of temperature variation on host and parasitoid populations compared with no or high resource degradation and parasitoid overall abundance was lower in fluctuating temperatures. Top-down regulation by the parasitoid and bottom-up regulation driven by resource degradation contributed to more than 50% of host and parasitoid population responses to temperature variation. Our results demonstrate that environmental degradation can strongly affect how species in a trophic interaction respond to short-term temperature fluctuations through direct and indirect trait-mediated effects. These effects are driven by species differences in sensitivity to environmental conditions and modulate top-down (parasitism) and bottom-up (resource) regulation. This study highlights the need to account for differences in the sensitivity of species' traits to environmental stressors to understand how interacting species will respond to simultaneous anthropogenic changes.

St J.; Burgess, Treena, I			Anthropogenic Disturbance Impacts Mycorrhizal Communities and Abiotic Soil Properties: Implications for an Endemic Forest Disease	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE				Article								In forest ecosystems, habitat fragmentation negatively impacts stand structure and biodiversity; the resulting fragmented patches of forest have distinct, disturbed edge habitats that experience different environmental conditions than the interiors of the fragments. In southwest Western Australia, there is a large-scale decline of the keystone tree species Corymbia calophylla following fragmentation and land use change. These changes have altered stand structure and increased their susceptibility to an endemic fungal pathogen, Quambalaria coyrecup, which causes chronic canker disease especially along disturbed forest habitats. However, the impacts of fragmentation on belowground processes in this system are not well-understood. We examined the effects of fragmentation on abiotic soil properties and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities, and whether these belowground changes were drivers of disease incidence. We collected soil from 17 sites across the distribution range of C. calophylla. Soils were collected across a gradient from disturbed, diseased areas to undisturbed, disease-free areas. We analysed soil nutrients and grew C. calophylla plants as a bioassay host. Plants were harvested and roots collected after 6 months of growth. DNA was extracted from the roots, amplified using fungal specific primers and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Concentrations of key soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were much higher along the disturbed, diseased edges in comparison to undisturbed areas. Disturbance altered the community composition of ECM and AM fungi; however, only ECM fungal communities had lower rarefied richness and diversity along the disturbed, diseased areas compared to undisturbed areas. Accounting for effects of disturbance, ECM fungal diversity and leaf litter depth were highly correlated with increased disease incidence in C. calophylla. In the face of global change, increased virulence of an endemic pathogen has emerged in this Mediterranean-type forest.	[Sapsford, Sarah J.; Paap, Trudy; Hardy, Giles E.

Social-ecological drivers and impacts of invasion-related regime shifts: consequences for ecosystem services and human wellbeing	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY				Article								There are growing concerns that increasing global environmental pressures could lead to the exceedance of critical ecological thresholds that could trigger long-lasting regime shifts that will affect the structure and function of ecosystems and the broader social-ecological systems in which they are embedded. Biological invasions are a major driver of global change, and a number of invasive species alter key ecological feedbacks in ways that lead to regime shifts, with consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem services, livelihoods and human wellbeing. We present four case studies, chosen to represent a diverse range of ecosystems and invasive taxa, to illustrate invasion-driven regime shifts in a variety of social-ecological systems globally. The case studies are: i) wattle trees (Australian Acacia species) in fynbos shrublands in South Africa; ii) Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in Lake Victoria in East Africa; iii) chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) within broad-leaved forests of eastern North America; and iv) the floating macrophytes salvinia (Salvinia molesta) and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea. For each case we identify the social and ecological drivers and feedbacks underlying the shift, the impacts on ecosystem services and human wellbeing, and the management options for reducing impacts. We discuss the value of using causal-loop diagrams to improve our understanding of the complex dynamics of shifts, and explore how concepts associated with regime shifts can inform guidelines for enhancing adaptive governance of biological invasions. Identifying species that have the potential to generate high-impact regime shifts, understanding the diversity of consequences for different environments and stakeholders, and developing robust management methods to reduce impacts and restore systems to improve social-ecological resilience and reduce vulnerability are priorities for further research.

Planning restoration requires knowledge of site conditions, including how sites are likely to respond under climate change. For objectives of production and high timber quality it is likely that ground preparation will be used, and planting with forest reproductive material (FRM) of known traits, such as: high survival and growth in establishment, drought tolerance adequate for climate projections, good resistance to pests and pathogens. For objectives associated with biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water supply protection, soil protection, natural regeneration could be a less costly solution with a limited amount of assisted translocation of selected FRM to improve resilience. If objectives are for rewilding forest areas, a degree of natural colonisation perhaps with translocation of some FRM could be a solution. Ignoring site conditions and suitability of available sources of FRM for forest restoration is likely to provide unexpected results with a mix of open ground, scrub and scattered trees resulting from climate, herbivore, and browsing impacts. The recent B4EST EU Horizon 2020 project examined progress in novel rapid approaches for testing the quality of FRM from existing genetic trials. Here we review the work of B4EST to show the opportunities from transformative tree breeding in forest restoration schemes, including: new climate projection ensembles at high temporal and spatial resolution to develop norms of reaction and transfer models with genetic components; multi-environment genotype-phenotype associations and multi-locus genotype-environment associations in identifying drivers of local adaptation; techniques for genomic selection using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to derive functional traits from polygenic associations; work on seed orchard site and climate specific FRM and zones for deployment; and work on some of the forest ecosystem service benefits derived at a landscape scale. We conclude that tree-breeding will provide robust forest restoration for planting, and rewilding (assisted natural regeneration), and if not "ignoring" but instead assisting natural colonisation processes - tree breeding may improve long-term forest resilience under environmental change.

However, in the pursuit of this knowledge, notions of the ecology of plant-pathogenic microorganisms have been reduced to a plant-centric and agro-centric focus. With increasing global change, i.e. changes that encompass not only climate, but also biodiversity, the geographical distribution of biomes, human demographic and socioeconomic adaptations and land use, new plant health problems will emerge via a range of processes influenced by these changes. Hence, knowledge of the ecology of plant pathogens will play an increasingly important role in the anticipation and response to disease emergence. Here, we present our opinion on the major challenges facing the study of the ecology of plant-pathogenic bacteria. We argue that the discovery of markedly novel insights into the ecology of plant-pathogenic bacteria is most likely to happen within a framework of more extensive scales of space, time and biotic interactions than those that currently guide much of the research on these bacteria. This will set a context that is more propitious for the discovery of unsuspected drivers of the survival and diversification of plant-pathogenic bacteria and of the factors most critical for disease emergence, and will set the foundation for new approaches to the sustainable management of plant health. We describe the contextual background of, justification for and specific research questions with regard to the following challenges: Development of terminology to describe plant-bacterial relationships in terms of bacterial fitness. Definition of the full scope of the environments in which plant-pathogenic bacteria reside or survive. Delineation of pertinent phylogenetic contours of plant-pathogenic bacteria and naming of strains independent of their presumed life style. Assessment of how traits of plant-pathogenic bacteria evolve within the overall framework of their life history.

No evidence for long-term increases in biomass and stem density in the tropical rain forests of Australia	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				Article								Pervasive increases in biomass and stem density of tropical forests have been recorded in recent decades, potentially having significant implications for carbon storage, biodiversity and ecosystem function. This trend is widely considered to be the result of multidecadal and global scale growth stimulation arising from increases in atmospheric CO2 and temperatures. However, contrasting patterns have been recorded across the tropics, and the role of disturbance in driving biomass and stem dynamics has been highlighted as an alternative explanation. Australian tropical forests have rarely been assessed in pan-tropical analyses of long-term dynamics. We have measured recruitment, mortality and growth in 20 permanent plots in tropical forest across north-eastern Australia since 1971. We assess changes in plot level above-ground live biomass (AGB) and stem density, and compare our results with those documented over a similar time frame in the neo-tropics. No significant increase in AGB was found over the 40-year time period. Above-ground biomass tended to increase over the first two decades of the monitoring period and decrease in the final two with gain terms (growth and recruitment) lower than loss terms (mortality) by the final decade (2000s). Stem density significantly decreased over the monitoring period with recruitment consistently lower than mortality. There was large variation in individual plots in their pattern of AGB and stem density changes over time which was consistent with the response of each plot to known disturbance events, including cyclones, pathogen outbreaks and drought. Our results are in contrast to those described for neo-tropical plots which appear to show a widespread pattern of increasing growth and stem density.Synthesis. The trend towards increasing biomass and stem density of tropical forests described for the neo-tropics does not necessarily reflect patterns in areas of the tropics where large-scale natural disturbances are relatively frequent. Australian tropical rain forests are either not increasing in productivity in response to global change, or cyclones and other regional and local mechanisms of change mask any evidence of larger-scale patterns.

J	Skrzecz, I; Tkaczyk, M; Oszako, T				Skrzecz, Iwona; Tkaczyk, Milosz; Oszako, Tomasz			Current Problems of Forest Protection (25-27 October 2022, Katowice Poland)	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL				Article								Forestry is one of the sectors particularly affected by the threats posed by changing climatic conditions. This is reflected in the deterioration of the health status of stands due to the synergistic effect of numerous abiotic and biotic factors. Current forest health problems are due to dynamic, negative changes in the forest environment. While the amount of precipitation remains at a similar level, its distribution varies throughout the year and, in particular, the lack of soil moisture during the growing season leads to the weakening of trees, including the main forest-forming species in Poland such as Pinus sylvestris. The weakening of trees, in turn, leads to species of insect pests that were previously considered secondary becoming primary pests, such as Ips acuminatus. It is likely that weakening of trees also favours increased occurrence of parasitic plants such as Viscum album ssp. austriacum or Loranthus europaeus. Infestations of the hemiparasitic, xylem-secreting pine mistletoe are of great interest because they are spreading rapidly throughout Europe. Drought in forests is not only a long-term water shortage, but also a situation in which plant-fungal relationships are disrupted. Reduced water availability leads to a number of negative changes in the soil and the mycobiota that live there, affecting entire ecosystems. The effects of climate change and increased international trade are leading to the spread of pathogenic fungi and other harmful organisms whose range was previously restricted to the south of our continent. Unfavourable abiotic and biotic factors leading to weakening of oak stands in the western part of Poland have resulted in activation of new pests like Mediterranean oak borer. Intensification of transport and shortening of its duration, as well as climatic changes, favour the introduction of various organisms, including bark beetles (Scolytinae). In Poland, cyclic insect outbreaks are one of the most important problems in forest protection. Developing methods to monitor, prevent outbreaks and control the density of insect populations below harmful levels can be a challenge to consider. Finding an innovative system for applying insecticides to control spruce bark beetle could also be an interesting solution, where insects attracted to pheromones die after contact with the insecticide. Contact with the insecticide has a dual effect: either directly when the tree is treated, or when the bark beetle attempts to invade the tree. Opportunities for the use of biostimulants in forestry and is an attractive way to regenerate plants after negative stressors such as frost, drought or damage caused by improper use of pesticides, as well as the negative effects of diseases and pests.

Conservation biology of banksias: insights from natural history to simulation modelling	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY				Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Advances in Plant Conservation Biology - Implications for Management and Restoration	OCT 25-27, 2005	Perth, AUSTRALIA					We have studied the ecology and conservation requirements of Banksia species in the species-rich sandplains of south-western Australia for 25 years. Loss of habitat through land-clearing has had the greatest impact on their conservation status over the last 50 years. Ascertaining optimal conditions for conservation management in bushland requires detailed knowledge of the species under consideration, including demographic attributes, fire regime, growing conditions and interactions with other species. Where populations have been fragmented, seed production per plant has also fallen. The group most vulnerable to the vagaries of fire, disease, pests, weeds and climate change are the non-sprouters, rather than the resprouters, with population extinction so far confined to non-sprouting species. Recent short-interval fires (< 8 years) appear to have had little impact at the landscape scale, possibly because they are rare and patchy. Fire intervals exceeding 25-50 years can also lead to local extinction. Up to 200 viable seeds are required for parent replacement in Banksia hookeriana when growing conditions are poor (low post-fire rainfall, commercial flower harvesting) and seed banks of this size can take up to 12 years to be reached. Seed production is rarely limited by pollinators, but interannual seasonal effects and resource availability are important. Genetic diversity of the seed store is quickly restored to the level of the parents in B. hookeriana. Florivores and granivores generally reduce seed stores, although this varies markedly among species. In Banksia tricuspis, black cockatoos actually increase seed set by selectively destroying borers. Potential loss of populations through the root pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi also challenges management, especially in the southern sandplains. Prefire dead plants are a poor source of seeds for the next generation when fire does occur. Harvesting seeds and sowing post-fire have much to commend them for critically endangered species. Bare areas caused by humans can result in ideal conditions for plant growth and seed set. However, in the case of B. hookeriana/B. prionotes, disturbance by humans has fostered hybridisation, threatening the genetic integrity of both species, whereas fine-textured soils are unsuitable for colonisation or rehabilitation. Few viable seeds become seedlings after fire, owing to post-release granivory and herbivory and unsuitable germination conditions. Seedling-competitive effects ensure that season/intensity of fire is not critical to recruitment levels, except in the presence of weeds. Water availability during summer-autumn is critical and poses a problem for conservation management if the trend for declining rainfall in the region continues. Our simulation modelling for three banksias shows that the probability of co-occurrence is maximal when fire is stochastic around a mean of 13 years, and where fire-proneness and post-fire recruitment success vary in the landscape. Modelling results suggest that non-sprouting banksias could not survive the pre-European frequent-fire scenario suggested by the new grasstree technique for south-western Australia. However, we have yet to fully explore the conservation significance of long-distance dispersal of seeds, recently shown to exceed 2.5 km in B. hookeriana.

Small forest patches of agricultural landscapes provide many ecosystem services and also the disservice of LB risk. Biotic interactions and environmental filtering shape tick host communities distinctively between specific regions of Europe, which makes evaluating the dilution effect hypothesis and its influence across various scales challenging. Latitude, macroclimate, landscape and habitat properties drive both hosts and ticks and are comparable metrics across Europe. Therefore, we instead assess these environmental drivers as indicators and determine their respective roles for the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus. Methods: We sampled I. ricinus and measured environmental properties of macroclimate, landscape and habitat quality of forest patches in agricultural landscapes along a European macroclimatic gradient. We used linear mixed models to determine significant drivers and their relative importance for nymphal and adult B. burgdorferi prevalence. We suggest a new prevalence index, which is pool-size independent. Results: During summer months, our prevalence index varied between 0 and 0.4 per forest patch, indicating a low to moderate disservice. Habitat properties exerted a fourfold larger influence on B. burgdorferi prevalence than macroclimate and landscape properties combined. Increasingly available ecotone habitat of focal forest patches diluted and edge density at landscape scale amplified B. burgdorferi prevalence. Indicators of habitat attractiveness for tick hosts (food resources and shelter) were the most important predictors within habitat patches. More diverse and abundant macro and microhabitat had a diluting effect, as it presumably diversifies the niches for tick-hosts and decreases the probability of contact between ticks and their hosts and hence the transmission likelihood. Conclusions: Diluting effects of more diverse habitat patches would pose another reason to maintain or restore high biodiversity in forest patches of rural landscapes. We suggest classifying habitat patches by their regulating services as dilution and amplification habitat, which predominantly either decrease or increase B. burgdorferi prevalence at local and landscape scale and hence LB risk. Particular emphasis on promoting LB-diluting properties should be put on the management of those habitats that are frequently used by humans. In the light of these findings, climate change may be of little concern for LB risk at local scales, but this should be evaluated further.

For the highly diverse orchid family, many species face imminent extinction. Successful re-introductions that result in self-sustaining populations require not only an understanding of existing threats, but an in-depth understanding of species ecology. Increasingly, translocations, ranging from re-introductions to assisted colonisation, are being adopted as recovery actions. Do these translocations mitigate threatening processes and account for the two key ecological attributes for orchid survival; pollinator and mycorrhizal presence? Here, we conducted a literature review identifying the known threats to orchid survival and their necessary mitigation strategies. Next, we evaluated the success of 74 published international orchid translocations on 66 species against a consideration of orchid ecological attributes. Lastly, we empirically tested an additional 22 previously unpublished re-introductions on 12 species undertaken since 2007 against a re-introduction process that accounts for identified threats and orchid ecological attributes. We identified habitat destruction, weed invasion, herbivory, illegal collection, pollinator decline, pathogens and climate change as critical threats to orchid survival. In our global review based on published translocations, the average survival rate, 1-year post translocation was 66 % yet only 2.8 % of studies reported natural recruitment in field sites. Although survival of translocated orchids is clearly being achieved, these programmes did not relate orchid growth and development to key ecological requirements of orchid population resilience, pollinator and mycorrhizal ecology. Ensuring pollinator and mycorrhizal presence shows that these two factors alone are key factors influencing survival and persistence in an Australian review of 22 previously unpublished orchid re-introductions. In the Australian review flowering in the year following, out-planting was observed for 81 % of the re-introductions with seed set occurring in 63 % of re-introductions within the length of the study. Recruitment was observed in 18 % of the Australian re-introduced populations indicating a degree of population resilience. As orchid re-introductions will be a major strategy for wild orchid conservation in the future, we present a framework for orchid re-introductions, including criteria for success. We recommend symbiotic propagation and, for specialised pollination syndromes, the study of pollinator interactions prior to site selection and re-introduction of plants.

B	de Azevedo, RK; Abdallah, VD		GhelerCosta, C; LyraJorge, MC; Verdade, LM		de Azevedo, Rodney Kozlowiski; Abdallah, Vanessa Doro			Fish Parasites and their Use as Environmental Research Indicators	BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL				Article; Book Chapter								Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world and presents the greatest diversity of species among all of the megadiverse countries, contributing approximately 14% of the world's biota. Currently, the biodiversity of the saltwater and freshwater ecosystems in Latin America have been threatened, mainly by environmental problems resulting from the degradation of ecosystems. Disruptive activities (monoculture, reforesting and cattle raising) in the drainage areas of rivers have reduced the native and riparian forests, thus triggering changes in the water quality and exposing the watershed to increasing erosion processes which lead to the siltation of the river bed, besides polluting its waters. From another perspective, the fish parasites have been indicated as excellent models for studies of parasite ecology and environmental indicators, considering that the features of the aquatic ecosystem, especially the physical-chemical characteristics of water, influence the composition and structure of parasites communities. Parasites are ubiquitous, though often invisible, components of ecosystems. They influence the survival and reproduction of individual hosts, the dynamics of host populations, and the structure of entire communities. Parasites are significant regulators of host populations and are potent agents that maintain the integrity and stability of ecosystems. Parasites, especially those that have complex life cycles involving more than one obligate host, are indicators of stable trophic structure in ecosystems. This is because all the biotic components necessary for completion of the life cycle must co-occur regularly in order to maintain any given parasite species. Knowing the complement of parasite species inhabiting any given host thus provides a means of rapid assessment of the breadth and form of trophic interactions of host species. Parasites are key to understanding the context of global change. Recently there has also been an increasing interest in the relationship between parasitism and pollution in the aquatic environment. Parasites may offer advantages over currently-used bioindicators including a more widespread distribution and a higher accumulation potential. Introduced parasites can have unpredictable and deleterious impacts on native species of hosts. It is therefore important to be able to quickly distinguish native from introduced parasite species.

J	Matosevic, D; Zivkovic, IP				Matosevic, Dinka; Zivkovic, Ivana Pajac			ALIEN PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECT AND MITE SPECIES ON WOODY PLANTS IN CROATIA	SUMARSKI LIST				Article								Alien species are defined as species living outside of their natural range and outside of their natural dispersal potential. When an alien species enters a novel environment and has negative ecological and economical impact it becomes invasive species. Alien species are considered as one of the major threats to biodiversity after habitat destruction and enormous damage is done by them to ecosystems and economies. They have been described as an outstanding global problem. Economic damages associated with alien species in several countries in the world amount to about 5 % of the world GNP. Numerous alien insect species, many introduced only in the last 200 years, have become successfully established in various ecosystems in Europe, 1541 species of alien invertebrates are already present, 94 % of them are arthropods and 90 % of them are insects. More than half of the alien invertebrates are phytophagous (52 %) and 30 % of them infest trees and shrubs. Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, time of introduction of alien species is essential for assessing the threats from alien species and the first requirement when assessing the impact of alien species on ecosystems is to make an alien species inventory of a certain territory or country. Such studies are needed to assess which taxonomic or bio-ecological groups of alien insects are more successful invaders or more harmful to environment and economy. Croatia lacks such an inventory. Even though Croatia was included in most recent and comprehensive study of alien terrestrial arthropodes in Europe, Croatian references with first records were totally missing. There is no up-to-date list of phytophagous alien insect species on woody plants in Croatia. The aim of this paper is to provide up-to-date comprehensive list of known phytophagous alien insect and mite species on woody plants in Croatia with all relevant Croatian references. The starting point for compiling the list of alien species of phytophagous insects on woody plants in Croatia was a book "Alien Terrestrial Arthropodes of Europe" and database DAISIE. These are primary online resources on alien insect species available to the public and first qualified reference system on invasive alien species for the European region. We compiled the list by searching many sources of forestry, agricultural and taxonomic entomological peer-reviewed literature in Croatia, checklists and primary research publications on alien insect species. The references in these sources were examined for additional relevant publications. A total of 101 phytophagous alien species (98 insect species from 6 orders and 3 mite species form subclass Acarina) on woody plants were recorded (Table 1) and they are already present in Croatian entomofauna. They were dominated by Hemiptera (56.4 %), Lepidoptera (14.9 %), Hymenoptera (12.9 %), followed by Diptera (5.9 %) and Coleoptera (5.9 %), Acarina (3 %) and Thysanoptera (1 %)(Figure 1). One third (33.7 %) of the alien species in Croatia originate from Asia, 26.7 % from North America while 12.9 % are of tropical origin (Figure 2). From the 101 established alien insect species in Croatia, an increase in the number of introductions can be noted in the first decade of 21st century (Figure 3). Agricultural lands are the most frequently invaded habitats by alien phytophagous insects in Croatia (56.4 %), followed by parks and gardens (28.7 %) and woodlands and forests (14.9 %)(Figure 4). Order Hemiptera clearly dominates as it includes some of the most successful invaders (57 %) on woody plants in Croatia. Similar results were obtained at a country level for Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Slovenia and Europe in general. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that species of this order remain undetected and are easily transported due to their tiny size in concert with the intensive trade in agricultural commodities. The occurrence of other orders (Lepidoptera 14 %, Hymenoptera 13 %, Diptera 6 %, Coleoptera 6 %, and Thysanoptera 1 %) is slightly different from other European countries. Results from several investigations have shown strong positive correlations between the number of alien insects per European country and the volume of manufactured and agricultural imports, road network size, the GDP and the geographic size. In contrast, alien species richness was not correlated with the total or percentage of forest cover. The number of alien insects is positively correlated with country surface area, and bordering the sea does not influence the number of alien insect species which is quite important for Croatia. There is a strong correlation between the number of alien insect species and the total amount of imports and level of international trade of the country. It can be predicted that the number of established alien insect species will grow as Croatia shows constant increase of traded commodities with other European and non-European countries. In this review we have listed alien insect species that have not yet been recorded for Croatia on European level. These are Oxycarenus lavaterae; Massilieurodes chitendeni; Adelges (Dreyfusia) nordmannianae; Pineus (Eopineus) strobi; Protopulvinaria pyriformis; Dryocosmus kuriphilus; Platygaster robinae; Aproceros leucopoda; Rhyzobius lophanthae; Rodolia cardinalis; Harmonia axyridis; Xylosandrus germanus; Caloptilia roscipennella; Caloptilia azaleella; Phyllocnistis citrella; Argyresthia thuiella; Cydalima perspectalis; Dasineura gleditchiae; Ceratitis capitata; Rhagoletis cingulata and Drosophila suzukii. Some of them are novel and only recently introduced alien species whereas some of them are present for decades in Croatia but due to the lack of a comprehensive and regularly updated inventory of alien species they have not been listed before. This also makes this up-to-date list of alien phytophagous insects in Croatia valuable. Our results have shown that Asia is the main region of origin of alien insects established in Croatia (33 %), followed by North America (27 %). The trends are similar in other European countries and Europe in general. A rapid increase in the number of new alien species introduction per year in Croatia is noticeable from the years 2007-2012 (6.4 species/year) compared to 2002-2007 (1.8 species/year) (Figure 3). In Europe, an average of 17.5 new species of insects per year was recorded between 2000 and 2007, while this value was only 8.1 from 1950 to 1974. In Europe twice as many new insect species were observed per year on trees and shrubs during the period 2000-2007 (6.3 species) compared to 1960-1979 (3.4 species). The differences between the number of new alien species/year in Europe and Croatia are probably due to differences in sampling efforts, country surface, volume of traded goods etc but the rapidly increasing trend is obvious. More than 80 % of alien insect species in Croatia (57 % on agricultural lands and 28 % in parks and gardens) have been established in man-made habitats (Figure 4). Only 15 % of alien insect species in Croatia have established themselves in natural environments (forests and woodlands) which is almost the same percentage as on European level. It is a common observation that simple, disturbed, man-made habitats are more easily invaded by insects and other invaders than complex, undisturbed, natural habitats. Alien insects linked to human environments and activities (e.g. ornamental plants, bonsais, seeds, large potted trees, cut flowers, vegetables, fruits) are more likely to be carried by human transports into a new region than insects living in natural areas. A study has shown that bonsais carry a more diverse alien insect fauna then timber and that ornamental plants constitute "miniature" ecosystems which may host a large variety of insects that have the potential to damage other woody plants as well. Almost 90 % of alien invertebrates in Europe were introduced unintentionally through human activities, mostly as contaminants of a commodity. In Europe, ornamental plant trade contributes significantly more than forestry products to the invasion of alien forest insects. As interception data have not been analysed in this paper, a research of such data for alien insect species and trade volumes in horticultural plants in Croatia is strongly needed. There is a strong suspicion that ornamental plants are one of main pathways of introduction of alien insects to Croatia due to the increase of the imported volumes from year to year. Alien insect species are known for being serious pests worldwide and they can impact habitats which they invade in several ways. Alien insects can affect native biodiversity through direct actions: phytophagous insects feeding on plants, a predator or a parasitoid attacking host, an alien species hybridizing with a native species or indirect actions: vectoring diseases, competing for food, or sharing natural enemies with native species. This research has shown that dangerous pests that can cause direct economic costs have invaded and are spreading in Croatia (Table 1). Due to high percentage of alien insect on agricultural lands (outdoor and in glasshouses) in Croatia (Figure 4) the yield losses of alien insect species on agricultural crops in Croatia must be considerable. Alien insects can have serious negative impact on forests, woodlands and urban parks. Some potentially damaging forest and urban pests have already established themselves in Croatia. In countries where the percentage of forest cover is high (Croatia around 44 %) the damage from alien insects is expected to be considerable. Most introductions of alien insects are unintentional and unpredictable. Less than 20 % of the alien invertebrates in Europe have been intercepted before their arrival. There are several harmful phytophagous alien species approaching the borders of Croatia: Agrilus planipennis which could pose serious threat to Croatian lowland oak ecosystems, Anoplophora sp. which is spreading rapidly in Northern Italy. Some of the most polyphagous alien insect species, such as Drosophila suzukii, have only recently been discovered in Croatia. This study has also shown a time lag between arrival and first record of an alien species which has direct implications on successful eradication measures. Climate change may directly influence establishment and colonisation of alien insect species in new territories-from other continents to Europe and from warmer European regions of Europe further north. Global warming is likely to influence establishment and spread of alien insect species from subtropical and tropical areas (24 % found in Croatia) especially on the Mediterranean coast. One of the main factors, globalisation, will definitely influence the upward trend of introduction and spread of new alien species in Croatia which will negatively influence economy and ecosystems.

J	Orsted, M; Yashiro, E; Hoffmann, AA; Kristensen, TN				Orsted, Michael; Yashiro, Erika; Hoffmann, Ary A.; Kristensen, Torsten Nygaard			Population bottlenecks constrain host microbiome diversity and genetic variation impeding fitness	PLOS GENETICS				Article								It is becoming increasingly clear that microbial symbionts influence key aspects of their host's fitness, and vice versa. This may fundamentally change our thinking about how microbes and hosts interact in influencing fitness and adaptation to changing environments. Here we explore how reductions in population size commonly experienced by threatened species influence microbiome diversity. Consequences of such reductions are normally interpreted in terms of a loss of genetic variation, increased inbreeding and associated inbreeding depression. However, fitness effects of population bottlenecks might also be mediated through microbiome diversity, such as through loss of functionally important microbes. Here we utilise 50 Drosophila melanogaster lines with different histories of population bottlenecks to explore these questions. The lines were phenotyped for egg-to-adult viability and their genomes sequenced to estimate genetic variation. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified in these lines to investigate microbial diversity. We found that 1) host population bottlenecks constrained microbiome richness and diversity, 2) core microbiomes of hosts with low genetic variation were constituted from subsets of microbiomes found in flies with higher genetic variation, 3) both microbiome diversity and host genetic variation contributed to host population fitness, 4) connectivity and robustness of bacterial networks was low in the inbred lines regardless of host genetic variation, 5) reduced microbial diversity was associated with weaker evolutionary responses of hosts in stressful environments, and 6) these effects were unrelated to Wolbachia density. These findings suggest that population bottlenecks reduce hologenomic variation (combined host and microbial genetic variation). Thus, while the current biodiversity crisis focuses on population sizes and genetic variation of eukaryotes, an additional focal point should be the microbial diversity carried by the eukaryotes, which in turn may influence host fitness and adaptability with consequences for the persistence of populations. Author summaryIt is becoming increasingly clear that organisms and the microbes that live on or in them-their microbiome-affect each other in profound ways that we are just beginning to understand. For instance, a diverse microbiome can help maintain metabolic functions or fight pathogens causing diseases. A disrupted microbiome may be especially critical for animals and plants that occur in low numbers because of threats from e.g. human exploitation or climate change, as they may already suffer from genetic challenges such as inbreeding and reduced evolutionary potential. The importance of such a reduction in population size, called a bottleneck, on the microbial diversity and the potential interactive effects on host health remains unexplored. Here we experimentally test these associations by investigating the microbiomes of 50 inbred or non-inbred populations of vinegar flies. We found that restricting the population size constrain the host's genetic variation and simultaneously decreases the diversity of the microbiome that they harbor, and that both effects were detrimental to host fitness. The microbial communities in inbred host populations were less robust than in their non-inbred counterparts, suggesting that we should increasingly consider the microbiome diversity, which may ultimately influence the health and persistence of threatened species.

Cereal landraces for sustainable agriculture. A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT				Review								Modern agriculture and conventional breeding and the liberal use of high inputs has resulted in the loss of genetic diversity and the stagnation of yields in cereals in less favourable areas. Increasingly landraces are being replaced by modern cultivars which are less resilient to pests, diseases and abiotic stresses and thereby losing a valuable source of germplasm for meeting the future needs of sustainable agriculture in the context of climate change. Where landraces persist there is concern that their potential is not fully realised. Much effort has gone into collecting, organising, studying and analysing landraces recently and we review the current status and potential for their improved deployment and exploitation, and incorporation of their positive qualities into new cultivars or populations for more sustainable agricultural production. In particular their potential as sources of novel disease and abiotic stress resistance genes or combination of genes if deployed appropriately, of phytonutrients accompanied with optimal micronutrient concentrations which can help alleviate aging-related and chronic diseases, and of nutrient use efficiency traits. We discuss the place of landraces in the origin of modern cereal crops and breeding of elite cereal cultivars, the importance of on-farm and ex situ diversity conservation; how modern genotyping approaches can help both conservation and exploitation; the importance of different phenotyping approaches; and whether legal issues associated with landrace marketing and utilisation need addressing. In this review of the current status and prospects for landraces of cereals in the context of sustainable agriculture, the major points are the following: (1) Landraces have very rich and complex ancestry representing variation in response to many diverse stresses and are vast resources for the development of future crops deriving many sustainable traits from their heritage. (2) There are many germplasm collections of landraces of the major cereals worldwide exhibiting much variation in valuable morphological, agronomic and biochemical traits. The germplasm has been characterised to variable degrees and in many different ways including molecular markers which can assist selection. (3) Much of this germplasm is being maintained both in long-term storage and on farm where it continues to evolve, both of which have their merits and problems. There is much concern about loss of variation, identification, description and accessibility of accessions despite international strategies for addressing these issues. (4) Developments in genotyping technologies are making the variation available in landraces ever more accessible. However, high quality, extensive and detailed, relevant and appropriate phenotyping needs to be associated with the genotyping to enable it to be exploited successfully. We also need to understand the complexity of the genetics of these desirable traits in order to develop new germplasm. (5) Nutrient use efficiency is a very important criterion for sustainability. Landrace material offers a potential source for crop improvement although these traits are highly interactive with their environment, particularly developmental stage, soil conditions and other organisms affecting roots and their environment. (6) Landraces are also a potential source of traits for improved nutrition of cereal crops, particularly antioxidants, phenolics in general, carotenoids and tocol in particular. They also have the potential to improve mineral content, particularly iron and zinc, if these traits can be uccessfully transferred to improved varieties. (7) Landraces have been shown to be valuable sources of resistance to pathogens and there is more to be gained from such sources. There is also potential, largely unrealised, for disease tolerance and resistance or tolerance of pest and various abiotic stresses too including to toxic environments. (8) Single gene traits are generally easily transferred from landrace germplasm to modern cultivars, but most of the desirable traits characteristic of landraces are complex and difficult to express in different genetic backgrounds. Maintaining these characteristics in heterogeneous landraces is also problematic. Breeding, selection and deployment methods appropriate to these objectives should be used rather than those used for high input intensive agriculture plant breeding. (9) Participatory plant breeding and variety selection has proven more successful than the approach used in high input breeding programmes for landrace improvement in stress-prone environments where sustainable approaches are a high priority. Despite being more complex to carry out, it not only delivers improved germplasm, but also aids uptake and communication between farmers, researchers and advisors for the benefit of all. (10) Previous seed trade legislation was designed primarily to protect trade and return royalty income to modern plant breeders with expensive programmes to fund. As the desirability of using landraces becomes more apparent to achieve greater sustainability, legislation changes are being made to facilitate this trade too. However, more changes are needed to promote the exploitation of diversity in landraces and encourage their use.	[Newton, A.

J	Kuzmin, SR; Rubtsov, AV; Barchenkov, AP; Karpyuk, TV				Kuzmin, Sergey R.; Rubtsov, Alexey, V; Barchenkov, Alexey P.; Karpyuk, Tatyana, V			Differentiation of larch (Larix spp.) climatypes in the Central Siberian forest-steppe provenance trial	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA				Article								Forest conservation is one of the main problems in world forestry. Numerous forest fires and widespread fungal pathogens and pests have led to a significant decline in forest areas and biodiversity and the disappearance of valuable populations. The problem of forest conservation and regeneration became especially relevant at the beginning of this century because of increasing wood harvesting. In this case, genetic collections of woody species, including provenance trials, established at different times play an important role in gene pool conservation of the main coniferous species - the forest-forming species in Russia - and in basic and applied problems in the context of climate change and the growing conditions in biogeocoenoses. The special interest in larch research is associated with a wide range of factors, such as inter- and intraspecific differentiation, capability to adapt to stressful growth conditions and the ability to successfully transfer seeds over large distances for creation of plantations with special purposes. The aim of this study was to assess inter- and intraspecific differences in height growth, crown area and length using the example of future generations of different larch species representing different provenances in the provenance trial. We obtained material for this study, located in the provenance trial research plot 'Pogorelsky bor' (56 degrees 22'06 '' N, 92 degrees 57'23 '' E) in the forest-steppe of Krasnoyarsk krai, in 2016. Live larch trees in the provenance trial were inventoried using the GIS complex `Field-Map'. The total number of inventoried trees was 1674. Nineteen provenances (climatic ecotypes) of various larch species (See Table and Fig. 1) were chosen for comparative analysis of height, crown area and crown length using a nonparametric method - the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test and Median test. The crown proportion of tree stems was assessed using median values. Trees with a diameter similar to that of the main sample (121-160 mm; 412 trees) and an alternative sample of trees with a wider diameter (181-220 mm; 291 trees) were chosen for comparative analysis. Such an approach enabled the assessment of different biometric traits of trees while accounting for diameter and similar growth conditions at the trial site. The number of trees in the main sample was 3 and 148 in the two provenances, whereas it ranged from 6 to 48 in the rest of the provenances. In this study, tree height (See Fig. 2) and tree crown length (See Fig. 4) differed between climatic ecotypes of different larch species in the forest-steppe provenance trial of the south Krasnoyarsk region. These differences were related to the origin of the climatypes. We found that larch climatypes from mountain regions showed lower tree height and crown length. We also found that descendants of larch that originated in climatically favourable areas or those connected to the hollows of southern Siberia and the Biryusa and Chuna river basins within the Pre-Sayan province, as well as representatives of the Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) and Chekanowskii larch (L. czekanowskii Szafer) from Chita Oblast, had greater tree height and tree crown length in the provenance trial (See Fig. 2 and 4). Therefore, the exploitation of these provenances for reforestation of the Krasnoyarsk forest-steppe may be reasonable and rational. Although the results obtained for 10-year-old trees (Iroshnikov, 1977) indicated that the height growth of the Petrovsk-Zabaikalski climatype (Chekanowskii larch) was lower than that of the Siberian and Dahurian larches, by the age of 50 years, it achieved a similar diameter and may be regarded as equal in height growth to the majority of representatives of the latter two larches in the forest-steppe zone. Comparative analysis of samples with different diameters showed that, in general, climatypes were in the same tree height groups (See Fig. 1). Our results show that significant differences in tree height between climatypes are not an obligatory condition for differences in crown length. Tree crown length has its own separate developmental strategy, which is genetically associated with the environmental conditions of the place of origin. The climatype from the highlands with the lowest hydrothermal coefficient of place of origin (the Tes-Khem climatype from Tyva) had the shortest crown length. The ratio of crown to full stem length of the Tes-Khem climatype was 18%. High crown lengths were found for larch climatypes from the hollows of southern Siberia and for representatives of the Dahurian larch from Amur Oblast (the Zeya climatype). The northernmost climatype from the southern taiga (the Motygino climatype, Angara river basin) had a crown length lower than that of the representatives of the Dahurian larch. The crown length proportion of the Zeya climatype (38%, the highest median value of the samples compared) was 14% higher than that of the Motygino climatype (24%). Differences in crown proportion of more than 5%-10% were observed between a few larch climatypes. In general, natural differences between species could not be defined. In this study, significant differences between samples representing different larch species were only found for crown length. The Gmelin larch had a significantly higher crown length than the Siberian (p < 0.001) and Japanese (p < 0.05) larches. In contrast to the other traits studied, crown area did not significantly influence the difference between climatypes. The reasons for the absence of significant differences were the high variability of this trait in the majority of climatypes and the presence of extremes in some samples (See Fig. 3).
